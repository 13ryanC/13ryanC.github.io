> *Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.*  
> — Søren Kierkegaard

Most of reading happens in the “forwards” direction: you bump into a book, spend some time with it, and move on. The understanding part tends to arrive later, if it arrives at all.

This page is a simple record of that forward motion. It collects books I’ve read and found interesting or useful, with occasional notes when I have something to say. Some entries are just a title and an author; others are longer attempts to work out what, if anything, a book has done to my thinking.

It is not meant to be complete, balanced, or definitive. It is just a way to keep track of what has passed through my hands, and to leave myself breadcrumbs for future me.

## What this page is (and isn’t)

Each book listed here links to a set of notes. Those notes are written primarily for myself. They are:

- Not formal reviews or recommendations.
- Not promises that the book is universally “good” or “important”.
- Often partial, provisional, and subject to revision.

Sometimes I try to articulate what a book illuminates, how it unsettles me, or where it exposes the limits of my thinking. Sometimes I just jot down a quote or a stray thought. Both levels of detail are allowed here.

## How the groupings work

The groupings below are **rough, overlapping labels**, not a strict ranking or a final judgement. They are there to give me (and you) a sense of how a book currently sits in my head:

- **Formative** – books that have, so far, durably reshaped how I think or act.  
- **Illuminating** – books that give me useful lenses, patterns, or clarifications for situations I regularly encounter.  
- **Encountered** – books I’ve read and engaged with, whose role is still emerging or more local.

A book could easily move between these over time, or belong to more than one. The labels are snapshots, not verdicts.

Over time, some of these will probably drift between sections, and many more will join them. I don’t expect the structure to be stable; the whole point is to let it evolve as the reading does.
