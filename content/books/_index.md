> *Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.*  
> — Søren Kierkegaard

All acts of creation run forward, whether it is writing books, pursuing new research, or more broadly producing and providing value to oneself and others.

It is always the reverse part that is difficult, whether it is reverse-engineering, doing post-mortems, or trying to undo things. Causal relationships are tangled in multifaceted ways, and we simply fail to comprehend their complexity and scope, while we cannot help trying—and fooling—ourselves, given how much we do not know and our many natural fallacies in decision-making.

This blog is a by-product of my desire to read many more books in an attempt to become more aware of the world around us and, most importantly, ourselves, a bit more each day.

## How this page is organised

Each book listed here links to a set of notes. They are not reviews or recommendations in the usual sense, but attempts to understand what the book illuminates, how it unsettles me, and where it exposes the limits of my thinking.  

The groupings below are rough markers of how deeply a book currently shapes my view of the world and myself, rather than a ranking of quality or agreement.

## Formative
