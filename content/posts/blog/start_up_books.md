Here is a list of books that I genuinely think and feel every startup founder MUST READ to avoid flopping their business by repeating mistakes others have already made—mistakes I think are stupid to repeat, yet ones I find myself still committed to avoiding. Meanwhile, I see others racing toward success on paths where they remain blind to the cliffs ahead, cliffs they will fall from by default if they don't actively look for them.

> Note: This is an ongoing effort; I'll be adding more books as I read more over time.

> For the time being, I will only provide book titles, but not any more detailed comments or clarification here. The book recommendations are genuine—ones that I have read thoroughly, page by page, with hand-written detailed notes—and I sincerely hope any startup founder or VC wishing to help founders would take the time and effort to read them thoroughly if they haven't already.
