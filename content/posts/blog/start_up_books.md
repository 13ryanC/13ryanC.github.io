Here is a list of books that I genuinely think and feel every startup founder MUST READ to avoid flopping their business by repeating mistakes others have already made—mistakes I think are stupid to repeat, yet ones I find myself still committed to avoiding. Meanwhile, I see others racing toward success on paths where they remain blind to the cliffs ahead, cliffs they will fall from by default if they don't actively look for them.

> Note: This is an ongoing effort; I'll be adding more books as I read more over time.

> For the time being, I will only provide book titles, but not any more detailed comments or clarification here. The book recommendations are genuine—ones that I have read thoroughly, page by page, with hand-written detailed notes—and I sincerely hope any startup founder or VC wishing to help founders would take the time and effort to read them thoroughly if they haven't already.

## The List

1. *The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed* by Alberto Savoia

* A crisp, practical guide to product–market fit—and how to test and measure it.

2. *Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future* by Mike Maples Jr. and Peter Ziebelman

* A contrarian framework for spotting truly disruptive start-ups, plus guidance on how to build one.

3. *Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts* by Annie Duke

* A solid primer on decision-making under moderate uncertainty (Mediocristan), not extreme uncertainty. Trading and entrepreneurship live in Extremistan, but this will still sharpen everyday judgment and cut avoidable errors.

4. *The Venture Mindset: How to Make Smarter Bets and Achieve Extraordinary Growth* by Ilya A. Strebulaev and Alex Dang

* A clear window, for founders, into how VCs think, decide, and act. If you want the VC mental model, start here.

5. *Measure What Matters: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth* by John Doerr

* The classic playbook for OKRs: set the right goals, measure what matters, and execute.

6. *The Cold Start Problem: How to Start and Scale Network Effects* by Andrew Chen

* A must-read for any entrepreneur—even if you’re not building a network-effects business. It’s so insightful and refreshing that if you can’t finish it cover-to-cover, you probably don’t have strong conviction for entrepreneurship.

7. *Radical Candor: Fully Revised and Updated Edition: How to Get What You Want by Saying What You Mean* by Kim Scott

* Must-read on how to communicate properly.

8. *High Growth Handbook: Scaling Startups from 10 to 10,000 People* by Elad Gil

* A solid distillation of scaling pitfalls. I think it is well worth reading to learn from others' mistakes rather than your own.

9. *User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product* by Jeff Patton with Peter Economy

* Somewhat outdated on longer planning horizons. The quickest path is shipping and gathering real market feedback. That said, some principles hold up well: using conversations and documents to build shared understanding, and the emphasis on deep user research. Story-mapping is useful too, though best done in a single sitting, followed by rapidly shipping and iterating to get fresh, actionable data to test market fit.
