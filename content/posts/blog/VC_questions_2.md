> Note: This is an ongoing effort; I'll be adding answers, reflections, and any new questions over time.

Venture capital cannot be understood by looking only at founders and term sheets; it must be analyzed upstream, because the incentives and constraints imposed by limited partners and institutional asset allocation shape how venture firms invest, govern, and ultimately behave once they are inside a company.

I have attempted to bootstrap several startups. All of them failed, for many reasons. But the root cause I identified after reflection was not timidity or lack of courage—it was the lack of knowledge and connections required to know that certain decisions existed, let alone how to make them.

This is my attempt to understand venture capital as a source of startup funding, a rebuke to my past self who was too ignorant to even know what questions to ask, and for those who claim they "don't have time to read books," a wake-up call. If you cannot find time to acquire knowledge that may dictate whether your startup succeeds or fails, you are not too busy; you are unprepared. This is especially true for inexperienced, first-time founders, for whom the excuses are most tempting and the consequences most severe.

In reality, every venture firm is a different creature. They vary by fund size, stage focus, sector expertise, partnership dynamics, LP base, incentive structures, and the individual personalities who sit across the table from you. No single description fits them all. But variation is not the same as randomness.

This is also my attempt, in service of my present and future self, to provide a structured way to dissect any VC firm you encounter—to understand the machinery beneath the brand, so you can ask better questions, interpret behavior more accurately, and negotiate from knowledge rather than hope.

29. How does fund size constrain strategy (ownership targets, check sizes, stage drift), and how does that shape founder outcomes?

**Internal Dynamics**

30. What internal metrics do partners optimize for (ownership percentage, markups, "graduation" rates, board seats)—and which are noisy or gameable?
31. When a fund underperforms early, what behaviors predictably change (pricing discipline, diligence depth, willingness to bridge, appetite for down rounds)?

43. Why does excess capital often increase prices rather than increase the supply of fundable startups?
44. Which interventions increase the supply of investable startups (education, immigration, spinouts, accelerators, and procurement)?

87. How should founders manage investor communications to maximize transparency without losing narrative control?

**Fiduciary Duties and Legal Boundaries**

88. Who owes fiduciary duties to whom (directors versus shareholders versus the corporate entity), and how does that change in distress or near-insolvency?
89. What is the boundary between advice and control that can create legal exposure (e.g., "shadow director" liability) for investors or founders?

96. How do liquidation preferences stack across multiple rounds, and when does preference overhang become exit-blocking?
97. How should founders evaluate whether "more capital at a higher valuation" is actually worse due to structure, preferences, or growth expectations it creates?

122. What does "benign" mean in measurable terms (consumer welfare, safety outcomes, labor practices, environmental impact)—and who adjudicates disputes when growth and mission conflict?
123. When do VC incentives systematically push toward negative externalities (growth-at-all-costs pressure, surveillance business models, addictive product design)—and what governance counterweights actually work?

128. What are the limits of advice derived from large platform-model firms (e.g., a]6z-style), and what changes for founders working with smaller funds, solo GPs, or non-platform investors?

---

## Glossary

**409A valuation:** An independent appraisal of a private company's common stock fair market value, required for setting employee option strike prices.

**Anti-dilution:** A provision protecting investors from dilution in down rounds; "weighted average" (more common) adjusts the conversion price proportionally, while "full ratchet" (more aggressive) resets it to the new lower price.

**BATNA:** Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement; the founder's strongest outside option, which determines real negotiating leverage.

**Capital-constrained vs. talent-constrained:** Whether an ecosystem's binding limitation is money supply or the supply of fundable founders and opportunities.

**Cramdown:** A financing round structured to severely dilute or wipe out earlier investors and/or common shareholders, typically in distress.

**Default alive / default dead:** Paul Graham's framework: whether a startup, at current revenue growth and burn rate, will reach profitability before running out of cash.

**Drag-along:** A right allowing majority shareholders (often investors) to force minority shareholders to participate in a sale on the same terms.

**DPI (Distributions to Paid-In):** Cash actually returned to LPs divided by capital contributed; measures realized, not paper, returns.

**GP / LP:** General Partners manage funds and make investment decisions; Limited Partners supply capital and have limited liability and involvement.

**GP commitment:** The capital GPs personally invest in their own fund, typically 1–5% of fund size, to align incentives with LPs.

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return):** The annualized time-weighted return on invested capital; sensitive to timing of cash flows.

**Liquidation preference:** The right of preferred shareholders to receive a specified return before common shareholders in a liquidity event; "1x non-participating" means investors get their money back OR convert to common (whichever is greater), while "participating" means they get their money back AND share in remaining proceeds.

**MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital):** Total value (realized plus unrealized) divided by capital invested; ignores time.

**Option pool shuffle:** Requiring founders to expand the option pool from their ownership before investment, effectively increasing investor ownership at the pre-money valuation.

**Participating preferred:** Preferred stock that receives its liquidation preference AND converts to common to share in remaining proceeds—"double dipping."

**Pay-to-play:** A provision requiring existing investors to participate pro-rata in a new round or face conversion of their preferred stock to common (losing preferences and protections).

**PME (Public Market Equivalent):** A method for benchmarking private fund returns against what the same cash flows would have earned in public markets.

**Preference overhang:** When cumulative liquidation preferences are large enough that common shareholders (founders, employees) receive little or nothing in moderate exit scenarios.

**Pro-rata rights:** The contractual right (not obligation) to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership percentage.

**Protective provisions:** Charter provisions requiring investor consent for specified corporate actions (raising debt, issuing new equity classes, selling the company, changing the board, etc.).

**Recycling:** Reinvesting early distributions back into the fund rather than distributing them to LPs, effectively increasing investable capital.

**Reserves:** Capital held back from initial deployment to participate in follow-on rounds for existing portfolio companies.

**SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity):** A Y Combinator-originated instrument that converts to equity in a future priced round; not debt, no maturity date or interest.

**Secondary sale:** A transaction where existing shareholders sell their shares (to other investors, the company, or third parties), as opposed to the company issuing new shares.

**Signaling:** The information conveyed by investor actions (leading, passing, exercising or waiving pro-rata) that affects how other investors perceive company quality.

**Tag-along (co-sale):** A right allowing minority shareholders to participate in a sale by majority shareholders on the same terms.

**Tender offer:** A company-organized process for shareholders to sell existing shares to a specified buyer, typically at a set price and with company approval.

**TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In):** Total fund value (realized distributions plus remaining portfolio value) divided by capital contributed; includes unrealized/paper gains.

**Venture-scale:** A company whose addressable market, margin structure, growth potential, and plausible exit paths can generate returns consistent with venture fund economics (typically 10x+ potential on invested capital).

**Voting agreement:** A contract among shareholders specifying how they will vote on designated matters (board elections, major transactions); operates alongside but separately from the corporate charter.
