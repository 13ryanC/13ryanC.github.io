Looking back at the development of artificial intelligence, we see evidence of sincere hope and persistent motivation in building AI systems—whether driven by intellectual pursuit, commercial ambitions, or the promise of convenience and future prosperity. Regardless of your stance on this topic, AI has already created transformational impacts across our lives, with repercussions we're only beginning to address.

I believe it's crucial that we build AI systems that are safe by default, not to our detriment.

Yet despite numerous pledges to make AI safe and aligned, surprisingly little has been done to help the average person understand and engage critically with these issues—let alone participate in shaping this technology directly. Currently, most AI safety bootcamps and courses, require participants to demonstrate strong backgrounds in computer science, programming, or mathematics just to get started.

This barrier is understandable from a resource allocation perspective, but it sacrifices accessibility and raises an important question: 

> **If spreading knowledge and awareness of AI safety and alignment is so important, why not invest more in education and make it truly accessible?**

The simple answer, frankly, is: what's the economic incentive?; what's the ROI (Return on Investment)?

Here I'll provide a brief outline of points on why I think there actually *is* a compelling case for broader AI safety eduction (incl. safety studies and culture): 

> **Investing in learning about AI safety and alignment reciprocally enhances our capability to build more powerful and useful AI systems**.

### Progress So Far

Working on it at the moment, but I will draw examples from my background of chemical engineering where I have extensive knoweledge and exposure on safety and control engineering for dealing with chemical process. Meanwhile, I will also read the AI safety books from Stuart Russell, Yokkowsky, and more, as well as referring sources from LessWrong, alignment forum and arxiv papers when relevant.
