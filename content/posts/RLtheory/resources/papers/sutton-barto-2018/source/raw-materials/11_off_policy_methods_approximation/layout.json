The two chapters preceding this have treated the on- policy case with function approximation, and in this chapter we treat the off- policy case with function approximation. The extension to function approximation turns out to be significantly different and harder for off- policy learning than it is for on- policy learning. The tabular off- policy methods developed in Chapters 6 and 7 readily extend to semi- gradient algorithms, but these algorithms do not converge as robustly as they do under on- policy training. In this chapter we explore the convergence problems, take a closer look at the theory of linear function approximation, introduce a notion of learnability, and then discuss new algorithms with stronger convergence guarantees for the off- policy case. In the end we will have improved methods, but the theoretical results will not be as strong, nor the empirical results as satisfying, as they are for on- policy learning. Along the way, we will gain a deeper understanding of approximation in reinforcement learning for on- policy learning as well as off- policy learning."

The extension of these techniques to function approximation are quickly dealt with in the first section of this chapter.Something more is needed for the second part of the challenge of off- policy learning with function approximation because the distribution of updates in the off- policy case is not according to the on- policy distribution. The on- policy distribution is important to the stability of semi- gradient methods. Two general approaches have been explored to deal with this. One is to use importance sampling methods again, this time to warp the update distribution back to the on- policy distribution, so that semi- gradient methods are guaranteed to converge (in the linear case). The other is to develop true gradient methods that do not rely on any special distribution for stability. We present methods based on both approaches. This is a cutting- edge research area, and it is not clear which of these approaches is most effective in practice."

These methods address the first part of the challenge of off- policy learning (changing the update targets) but not the second part (changing the update distribution). Accordingly, these methods may diverge in some cases, and in that sense are not sound, but still they are often successfully used. Remember that these methods are guaranteed stable and asymptotically unbiased for the tabular case, which corresponds to a special case of function approximation. So it may still be possible to combine them with feature selection methods in such a way that the combined system could be assured stable. In any event, these methods are simple and thus a good place to start."

We have seen this repeatedly, such as in Chapters 7 (Figure 7.2) and 9 (Figure 9.2), where some degree of bootstrapping performed much better than Monte Carlo methods on the random- walk prediction task, and in Chapter 10 where the same was seen on the Mountain- Car control task (Figure 10.4). Many other problems show much faster learning with bootstrapping (e.g., see Figure 12.14). Bootstrapping often results in faster learning because it allows learning to take advantage of the state property, the ability to recognize a state upon returning to it. On the other hand, bootstrapping can impair learning on problems where the state representation is poor and causes poor generalization (e.g., this seems to be the case on Tetris, see Simsek, Algorta, and Kothiyal, 2016). A poor state representation can also result in bias; this is the reason for the poorer bound on the asymptotic approximation quality of bootstrapping methods (Equation 9.14). On balance, the ability to bootstrap has to be considered extremely valuable. One may sometimes choose not to use it by selecting long "

For model- free reinforcement learning, one can simply use Sarsa rather than Q- learning. Off- policy methods free behavior from the target policy. This could be considered an appealing convenience but not a necessity. However, off- policy learning is essential to other anticipated use cases, cases that we have not yet mentioned in this book but may be important to the larger goal of creating a powerful intelligent agent."

There is extensive psychological evidence that people and animals learn to predict many different sensory events, not just rewards. We can be surprised by unusual events, and correct our predictions about them, even if they are of neutral valence (neither good nor bad). This kind of prediction presumably underlies predictive models of the world such as are used in planning. We predict what we will see after eye movements, how long it will take to walk home, the probability of making a jump shot in basketball, and the satisfaction we will get from taking on a new project. In all these cases, the events we would like to predict depend on our acting in a certain way. To learn them all, in parallel, requires learning from the one stream of experience. There are many target policies, and thus the one behavior policy cannot equal all of them. Yet parallel learning is conceptually possible because the behavior policy may overlap in part with many of the target policies. To take full advantage of this requires off- policy learning."

The best approximators in the Bellman error (BE), projected Bellman error (PBE), and temporal difference error (TDE) senses are all potentially different and are shown in the lower right. (VE, BE, and PBE are all treated as the corresponding vectors in this figure.) The Bellman operator takes a value function in the plane to one outside, which can then be projected back. If you iteratively applied the Bellman operator outside the space (shown in gray above) you would reach the true value function, as in conventional dynamic programming. If instead you kept projecting back into the subspace at each step, as in the lower step shown in gray, then the fixed point would be the point of vector-zero PBE."

These methods always go downhill (in expectation) in the objective and because of this are typically stable with excellent convergence properties. Among the algorithms investigated so far in this book, only the Monte Carlo methods are true SGD methods. These methods converge robustly under both on- policy and off- policy training as well as for general nonlinear (differentiable) function approximators, though they are often slower than semi- gradient methods with bootstrapping, which are not SGD methods. Semi- gradient methods may diverge under off- policy training, as we have seen earlier in this chapter, and under contrived cases of nonlinear function approximation (Tsitsiklis and Van Roy, 1997). With a true SGD method such divergence would not be possible."

The starting place of all such efforts is the choice of an error or objective function to optimize. In this and the next section we explore the origins and limits of the most popular proposed objective function, that based on the Bellman error introduced in the previous section. Although this has been a popular and influential approach, the conclusion that we reach here is that it is a misstep and yields no good learning algorithms. On the other hand, this approach fails in an interesting way that offers insight into what might constitute a good approach."

Thus, a Bellman- error- minimizing algorithm should have no trouble with the A- split example. We cannot expect to achieve zero Bellman error in general, as it would involve finding the true value function, which we presume is outside the space of representable value functions. But getting close to this ideal is a natural- seeming goal. As we have seen, the Bellman error is also closely related to the TD error. The Bellman error for a state is the expected TD error in that state. So let's repeat the derivation above with the expected TD error (all expectations here are implicitly conditional on "

The first of these is that empirically it is slow, much slower than semi- gradient methods. Indeed, proponents of this method have proposed increasing its speed by combining it with faster semi- gradient methods initially, then gradually switching over to residual gradient for the convergence guarantee (Baird and Moore, 1999). The second way in which the residual- gradient algorithm is unsatisfactory is that it still seems to converge to the wrong values. It does get the right values in all tabular cases, such as the A- split example, as for those an exact solution to the Bellman"

The logic of the primary learning process relies on the secondary learning process having finished, at least approximately, whereas the secondary learning process proceeds without being influenced by the first. We call this sort of asymmetrical dependence a cascade.

The convergence proofs for these methods often make this assumption explicitly. These are called two- time- scale proofs. The fast time scale is that of the secondary learning process, and the slower time scale is that of the primary learning process. If "

Hybrid- TD algorithms behave like Gradient- TD algorithms in states where the target and behavior policies are very different, and behave like semi- gradient algorithms in states where the target and behavior policies are the same. Finally, the Gradient- TD idea has been combined with the ideas of proximal methods and control variates to produce more efficient methods (Mahadevan et al., 2014; Du et al., 2017)."

Consider an undiscounted episodic problem. The way episodes terminate is fully determined by the transition probabilities, but there may be several different ways the episodes might begin. However the episodes start, if all state transitions are due to the target policy, then the state distribution that results is an on- policy distribution. You might start close to the terminal state and visit only a few states with high probability before ending the episode. Or you might start far away and pass through many states before terminating. Both are on- policy distributions, and training on both with a linear semi- gradient method would be guaranteed to be stable. However the process starts, an on- policy distribution results as long as all states encountered are updated up until termination."

These trajectories are obtained by iteratively computing the expectation of the parameter vector trajectory without any of the variance due to sampling of transitions and rewards. We do not show the results of applying the Emphatic- TD algorithm directly because its variance on Baird's counterexample is so high that it is high impossible to get consistent results in computational experiments. The algorithm converges to the optimal solution in theory on this problem, but in practice it does not. We turn to the topic of reducing the variance of all these algorithms in the next section."

The raison d'etre of off- policy learning is to enable generalization to this vast number of related- but- not- identical policies. The problem remains of how to make the best use of the experience. Now that we have some methods that are stable in expected value (if the step sizes are set right), attention naturally turns to reducing the variance of the estimates. There are many possible ideas, and we can just touch on a few of them in this introductory text."

As we have seen, importance sampling often involves products of policy ratios. The ratios are always one in expectation (5.13), but their actual values may be very high or as low as zero. Successive ratios are uncorrelated, so their products are also always one in expected value, but they can be of very high variance. Recall that these ratios multiply the step size in SGD methods, so high variance means taking steps that vary greatly in their sizes. This is problematic for SGD because of the occasional very large steps. They must not be so large as to take the parameter to a part of the space with a very different gradient. SGD methods rely on averaging over multiple steps to get a good sense of the gradient, and if they make large moves from single samples they become unreliable. If the step- size parameter is set small enough to prevent this, then the expected step"

One reason to seek off- policy algorithms is to give flexibility in dealing with the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Another is to free behavior from learning, and avoid the tyranny of the target policy. TD learning appears to hold out the possibility of learning about multiple things in parallel, of using one stream of experience to solve many tasks simultaneously. We can certainly do this in special cases, just not in every case that we would like to or as efficiently as we would like to."

However, our analysis concludes that this is not an appealing goal in many cases, and that anyway it is impossible to achieve with a learning algorithm—the gradient of the BE is not learnable from experience that reveals only feature vectors and not underlying states.

Other examples of instability with off- policy DP methods and more complex methods of function approximation are given by Boyan and Moore (1995).

The most sensitive empirical investigations to date of Gradient- TD and related methods are given by Geist and Scherrer (2014), Dann, Neumann, and Peters (2014), White (2015), and Ghiassian, Patterson, White, Sutton, and White (2018). Recent developments in the theory of Gradient- TD methods are presented by Yu (2017)."
