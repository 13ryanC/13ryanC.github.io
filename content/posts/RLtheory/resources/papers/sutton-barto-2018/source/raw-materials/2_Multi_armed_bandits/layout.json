This is what creates the need for active exploration, for an explicit search for good behavior. Purely evaluative feedback indicates how good the action taken was, but not whether it was the best or the worst action possible. Purely instructive feedback, on the other hand, indicates the correct action to take, independently of the action actually taken. This kind of feedback is the basis of supervised learning, which includes large parts of pattern classification, artificial neural networks, and system identification. In their pure forms, these two kinds of feedback are quite distinct: evaluative feedback depends entirely on the action taken, whereas instructive feedback is independent of the action taken."

This nonassociative setting is the one in which most prior work involving evaluative feedback has been done, and it avoids much of the complexity of the full reinforcement learning problem. Studying this case enables us to see most clearly how evaluative feedback differs from, and yet can be combined with, instructive feedback."

We call these the greedy actions. When you select one of these actions, we say that you are exploiting your current knowledge of the values of the actions. If instead you select one of the nongreedy actions, then we say you are exploring, because this enables you to improve your estimate of the nongreedy action's value. Exploitation is the right thing to do to maximize the expected reward on the one step, but exploration may produce the greater total reward in the long run. For example, suppose a greedy action's value is known with certainty, while several other actions are estimated to be nearly as good but with substantial uncertainty. The uncertainty is such that at least one of these other actions probably is actually better than the greedy action, but you don't know which one. If you have many time steps ahead on which to make action selections, then it may be better to explore the nongreedy actions and discover which of them are better than the greedy action. Reward is lower in the short run, during exploration, but higher in the long run because after you have discovered the better actions, you can exploit them many times. Because it is not possible both to explore and to exploit with any single action selection, one often refers to the \"conflict\" between exploration and exploitation."

On the other hand, if the reward variances were zero, then the greedy method would know the true value of each action after trying it once. In this case the greedy method might actually perform best because it would soon find the optimal action and then never explore. But even in the deterministic case there is a large advantage to exploring if we weaken some of the other assumptions. For example, suppose the bandit task were nonstationary, that is, the true values of the actions changed over time. In this case exploration is needed even in the deterministic case to make sure one of the nongreedy actions has not changed to become better than the greedy one. As we shall see in the next few chapters, nonstationarity is the case most commonly encountered in reinforcement learning. Even if the underlying task is stationary and deterministic, the learner faces a set of banditlike decision tasks each of which changes over time as learning proceeds and the agent's decision- making policy changes. Reinforcement learning requires a balance between exploration and exploitation."

As noted earlier, we often encounter reinforcement learning problems that are effectively nonstationary. In such cases it makes sense to give more weight to recent rewards than to long- past rewards. One of the most popular ways of doing this is to use a constant step- size parameter. For example, the incremental update rule (2.3) for updating an average "

In the latter case, the second condition is not met, indicating that the estimates never completely converge but continue to vary in response to the most recently received rewards. As we mentioned above, this is actually desirable in a nonstationary environment, and problems that are effectively nonstationary are the most common in reinforcement learning. In addition, sequences of step- size parameters that meet the conditions (2.7) often converge very slowly or need considerable tuning in order to obtain a satisfactory convergence rate. Although sequences of step- size parameters that meet these convergence conditions are often used in theoretical work, they are seldom used in applications and empirical research."

Indeed, any method that focuses on the initial conditions in any special way is unlikely to help with the general nonstationary case. The beginning of time occurs only once, and thus we should not focus on it too much. This criticism applies as well to the sample- average methods, which also treat the beginning of time as a special event, averaging all subsequent rewards with equal weights. Nevertheless, all of these methods are very simple, and one of them—or some simple combination of them—is often adequate in practice. In the rest of this book we make frequent use of several of these simple exploration techniques."

For example, we could have set it to zero, or to 1000, and the algorithm would still be an instance of stochastic gradient ascent. The choice of the baseline does not affect the expected update of the algorithm, but it does affect the variance of the update and thus the rate of convergence (as shown, for example, in Figure 2.5). Choosing it as the average of the rewards may not be the very best, but it is simple and works well in practice."

In these tasks the learner either tries to find a single best action when the task is stationary, or tries to track the best action as it changes over time when the task is nonstationary. However, in a general reinforcement learning task there is more than one situation, and the goal is to learn a policy: a mapping from situations to the actions that are best in those situations. To set the stage for the full problem, we briefly discuss the simplest way in which nonassociative tasks extend to the associative setting."

Although this is a difficult question to answer in general, we can certainly run them all on the 10- armed testbed that we have used throughout this chapter and compare their performances. A complication is that they all have a parameter; to get a meaningful comparison we have to consider their performance as a function of their parameter. Our graphs so far have shown the course of learning over time for each algorithm and parameter setting, to produce a learning curve for that algorithm and parameter setting. If we plotted learning curves for all algorithms and all parameter settings, then the graph would be too complex and crowded to make clear comparisons. Instead we summarize a complete learning curve by its average value over the 1000 steps; this value is proportional to the area under the learning curve. Figure 2.6 shows this measure for the various bandit algorithms from this chapter, each as a function of its own parameter shown on a single scale on the x- axis. This kind of graph is called a parameter study. Note that the parameter values are varied by factors of two and presented on a log scale. Note also the characteristic inverted- U shapes of each algorithm's performance; all the algorithms perform best at an intermediate value of their parameter, neither too large nor too small.

One possibility is to then select actions at each step according to their posterior probability of being the best action. This method, sometimes called posterior sampling or Thompson sampling, often performs similarly to the best of the distribution- free methods we have presented in this chapter."

The term associative reinforcement learning has also been used for associative search (Barto and Anandan, 1985), but we prefer to reserve that term as a synonym for the full reinforcement learning problem (as in Sutton, 1984). (And, as we noted, the modern literature also uses the term \"contextual bandits\" for this problem.) We note that Thorndike's Law of Effect (quoted in Chapter 1) describes associative search by referring to the formation of associative links between situations (states) and actions. According to the terminology of operant, or instrumental, conditioning (e.g., Skinner, 1938), a discriminative stimulus is a stimulus that signals the presence of a particular reinforcement contingency. In our terms, different discriminative stimuli correspond to different states."

The Gittins index approach is due to Gittins and Jones (1974). Duff (1995) showed how it is possible to learn Gittins indices for bandit problems through reinforcement learning. The survey by Kumar (1985) provides a good discussion of Bayesian and non- Bayesian approaches to these problems. The term information state comes from the literature on partially observable MDPs; see, for example, Lovejoy (1991)."

One way to formalize exploration efficiency is by adapting to reinforcement learning the notion of sample complexity for a supervised learning algorithm, which is the number of training examples the algorithm needs to attain a desired degree of accuracy in learning the target function. A definition of the sample complexity of exploration for a reinforcement learning algorithm is the number of time steps in which the algorithm does not select near- optimal actions (Kakade, 2003). Li (2012) discusses this and several other approaches in a survey of theoretical approaches to exploration efficiency in reinforcement learning. A thorough modern treatment of Thompson sampling is provided by Russo et al. (2018)."
