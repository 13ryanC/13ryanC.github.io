One of the most exciting aspects of reinforcement learning is the mounting evidence from neuroscience that the nervous systems of humans and many other animals implement algorithms that correspond in striking ways to reinforcement learning algorithms. The main objective of this chapter is to explain these parallels and what they suggest about the neural basis of reward- related learning in animals."

Dopamine appears to convey temporal- difference (TD) errors to brain structures where learning and decision making take place. This parallel is expressed by the reward prediction error hypothesis of dopamine neuron activity, a hypothesis that resulted from the convergence of computational reinforcement learning and results of neuroscience experiments. In this chapter we discuss this hypothesis, the neuroscience findings that led to it, and why it is a significant contribution to understanding brain reward systems. We also discuss parallels between reinforcement learning and neuroscience that are less striking than this dopamine/TD- error parallel but that provide useful conceptual tools for thinking about reward- based learning in animals. Other elements of reinforcement learning have the potential to impact the study of nervous systems, but their connections to neuroscience are still relatively undeveloped. We discuss several of these evolving connections that we think will grow in importance over time."

A second objective of this chapter is to acquaint readers with ideas about brain function that have contributed to our approach to reinforcement learning. Some elements of reinforcement learning are easier to understand when seen in light of theories of brain function. This is particularly true for the idea of the eligibility trace, one of the basic mechanisms of reinforcement learning, that originated as a conjectured property of synapses, the structures by which nerve cells—neurons—communicate with one another."

We also do not do justice to hypotheses and models that are alternatives to those that align so well with reinforcement learning. It should not be surprising that there are differing views among experts in the field. We can only provide a glimpse into this fascinating and developing story. We hope, though, that this chapter convinces you that a very fruitful channel has emerged connecting reinforcement learning and its theoretical underpinnings to the neuroscience of reward- based learning in animals."

They come in many forms, but a neuron typically has a cell body, dendrites, and a single axon. Dendrites are structures that branch from the cell body to receive input from other neurons (or to also receive external signals in the case of sensory neurons). A neuron's axon is a fiber that carries the neuron's output to other neurons (or to muscles or glands). A neuron's output consists of sequences of electrical pulses called action potentials that travel along the axon. Action potentials are also called spikes, and a neuron is said to fire when it generates a spike. In models of neural networks it is common to use real numbers to represent a neuron's firing rate, the average number of spikes per some unit of time."

A synapse transmits information from the presynaptic neuron's axon to a dendrite or cell body of the postsynaptic neuron. With a few exceptions, synapses release a chemical neurotransmitter upon the arrival of an action potential from the presynaptic neuron. (The exceptions are cases of direct electric coupling between neurons, but these will not concern us here.) Neurotransmitter molecules released from the presynaptic side of the synapse diffuse across the synaptic cleft, the very small space between the presynaptic ending and the postsynaptic neuron, and then bind to receptors on the surface of the postsynaptic neuron to excite or inhibit its spike- generating activity, or to modulate its behavior in other ways. A particular neurotransmitter may bind to several different types of receptors, with each producing a different effect on the postsynaptic neuron. For example, there are at least five different receptor types by which the neurotransmitter dopamine can affect a postsynaptic neuron. Many different chemicals have been identified as neurotransmitters in animal nervous systems."

Background activity can be irregular due to input from the wider network, or due to noise within the neuron or its synapses. Sometimes background activity is the result of dynamic processes intrinsic to the neuron. A neuron's phasic activity, in contrast to its background activity, consists of bursts of spiking activity usually caused by synaptic input. Activity that varies slowly and often in a graded manner, whether as background activity or not, is called a neuron's tonic activity."

One way a nervous system can change through experience is through changes in synaptic efficacies as a result of combinations of the activities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, and sometimes by the presence of a neuromodulator, which is a neurotransmitter having effects other than, or in addition to, direct fast excitation or inhibition."

Neuromodulation can alter the function of neural circuits, mediate motivation, arousal, attention, memory, mood, emotion, sleep, and body temperature. Important here is that a neuromodulatory system can distribute something like a scalar signal, such as a reinforcement signal, to alter the operation of synapses in widely distributed sites critical for learning."

In Chapter 3 we said that any problem of learning goal- directed behavior can be reduced to the three signals representing actions, states, and rewards. However, to explain links that have been made between neuroscience and reinforcement learning, we have to be less abstract than this and consider other reinforcement learning signals that correspond, in certain ways, to signals in the brain. In addition to reward signals, these include reinforcement signals (which we argue are different from reward signals), value signals, and signals conveying prediction errors. When we label a signal by its function in this way, we are doing it in the context of reinforcement learning theory in which the signal corresponds to a term in an equation or an algorithm. On the other hand, when we refer to a signal in the brain, we mean a physiological event such as a burst of action potentials or the secretion of a neurotransmitter. Labeling a neural signal by its function, for example calling the phasic activity of a dopamine neuron a reinforcement signal, means that the neural signal behaves like, and is conjectured to function like, the corresponding theoretical signal."

Neural activity related to reward processing can be found in nearly every part of the brain, and it is difficult to interpret results unambiguously because representations of different reward- related signals tend to be highly correlated with one another. Experiments need to be carefully designed to allow one type of reward- related signal to be distinguished with any degree of certainty from others- or from an abundance of other signals not related to reward processing. Despite these difficulties, many experiments have been conducted with the aim of reconciling aspects of reinforcement learning theory and algorithms with neural signals, and some compelling links have been established. To prepare for examining these links, in the rest of this section we remind the reader of what various reward- related signals mean according to reinforcement learning theory."

Reward prediction errors (RPEs) specifically measure discrepancies between the expected and the received reward signal, being positive when the reward signal is greater than expected, and negative otherwise. TD errors like (6.5) are special kinds of RPEs that signal discrepancies between current and earlier expectations of reward over the long- term. When neuroscientists refer to RPEs they generally (though not always) mean TD RPEs, which we simply call TD errors throughout this chapter. Also in this chapter, a TD error is generally one that does not depend on actions, as opposed to TD errors used in learning action- values by algorithms like Sarsa and Q- learning. This is because the most well- known links to neuroscience are stated in terms of action- free TD errors, but we do not mean to rule out possible similar links involving action- dependent TD errors. (TD errors for predicting signals other than rewards are useful too, but that case will not concern us here. See, for example, Modayil, White, and Sutton, 2014. )"

Is an observed signal more like a reward signal, a value signal, a prediction error, a reinforcement signal, or something altogether different? And if it is an error signal, is it an RPE, a TD error, or a simpler error like the Rescorla- Wagner error (14.3)? And if it is a TD error, does it depend on actions like the TD error of Q- learning or Sarsa? As indicated above, probing the brain to answer questions like these is extremely difficult. But experimental evidence suggests that one neurotransmitter, specifically the neurotransmitter dopamine, signals RPEs, and further, that the phasic activity of dopamine- producing neurons in fact conveys TD errors (see Section 15.1 for a definition of phasic activity). This evidence led to the reward prediction error hypothesis of dopamine neuron activity, which we describe next."

This is the same issue we discussed in Section 14.2.4 for the TD model. Montague et al. show a complete serial compound (CSC) representation as shown in the left column of Figure 14.1, but where the sequence of short- duration internal signals continues until the onset of the US, which here is the arrival of a non- zero reward signal. This representation allows the TD error to mimic the fact that dopamine neuron activity not only predicts a future reward, but that it is also sensitive to when after a predictive cue that reward is expected to arrive. There has to be some way to keep track of the time between sensory cues and the arrival of reward. If a stimulus initiates a sequence of internal signals that continues after the stimulus ends, and if there is a different signal for each time step following the stimulus, then each time step after the stimulus is represented by a distinct state. Thus, the TD error, being state- dependent, can be sensitive to the timing of events within a trial."

There are situations, however, in which predictions based on the hypothesis do not match what is observed in experiments. The choice of input representation is critical to how closely TD errors match some of the details of dopamine neuron activity, particularly details about the timing of dopamine neuron responses. Different ideas, some of which we discuss below, have been proposed about input representations and other features of TD learning to make the TD errors fit the data better, though the main parallels appear with the CSC representation that Montague et al. used. Overall, the reward prediction error hypothesis has received wide acceptance among neuroscientists studying reward- based learning, and it has proven to be remarkably resilient in the face of accumulating results from neuroscience experiments."

Dopamine plays essential roles in many processes in the mammalian brain. Prominent among these are motivation, learning, action- selection, most forms of addiction, and the disorders schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is called a neuromodulator because it performs many functions other than direct fast excitation or inhibition of targeted neurons. Although much remains unknown about dopamine's functions and details of its cellular effects, it is clear that it is fundamental to reward processing in the mammalian brain. Dopamine is not the only neuromodulator involved in reward processing, and its role in aversive situations—punishment—remains controversial. Dopamine also can function differently in non- mammals. But no one doubts that dopamine is essential for reward- related processes in mammals, including humans."

This view followed from a famous 1954 paper by James Olds and Peter Milner that described the effects of electrical stimulation on certain areas of a rat's brain. They found that electrical stimulation to particular regions acted as a very powerful reward in controlling the rat's behavior: \"...the control exercised over the animal's behavior by means of this reward is extreme, possibly exceeding that exercised by any other reward previously used in animal experimentation\" (Olds and Milner, 1954). Later research revealed that the sites at which stimulation was most effective in producing this rewarding effect excited dopamine pathways, either directly or indirectly, that ordinarily are excited by natural rewarding stimuli. Effects similar to these were also observed with human subjects. These observations strongly suggested that dopamine neuron activity signals reward."

Electrical stimulation not only energized the rats' behavior—through dopamine's effect on motivation—it also led to the rats quickly learning to stimulate themselves by pressing a lever, which they would do frequently for long periods of time. The activity of dopamine neurons triggered by electrical stimulation reinforced the rats' lever pressing."

These methods allow neuroscientists to precisely control the activity of selected neuron types at a millisecond timescale in awake behaving animals. Optogenetic methods introduce light- sensitive proteins into selected neuron types so that these neurons can be activated or silenced by means of flashes of laser light. The first experiment using optogenetic methods to study dopamine neurons showed that optogenetic stimulation producing phasic activation of dopamine neurons in mice was enough to condition the mice to prefer the side of a chamber where they received this stimulation as compared to the chamber's other side where they received no, or lower- frequency, stimulation (Tsai et al. 2009). In another example, Steinberg et al. (2013) used optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons to create artificial bursts of dopamine neuron activity in rats at the times when rewarding stimuli were expected but omitted—times when dopamine neuron activity normally pauses. With these pauses replaced by artificial bursts, responding was sustained when it would ordinarily decrease due to lack of reinforcement (in extinction trials), and learning was enabled when it would ordinarily be blocked due to the reward being already predicted (the blocking paradigm; Section 14.2.1)."

The basal ganglia are a collection of neuron groups, or nuclei, lying at the base of the forebrain. The main input structure of the basal ganglia is called the striatum. Essentially all of the cerebral cortex, among other structures, provides input to the striatum. The activity of cortical neurons conveys a wealth of information about sensory input, internal states, and motor activity. The axons of cortical neurons make synaptic contacts on the dendrites of the main input/output neurons of the striatum, called medium spiny neurons. Output from the striatum loops back via other basal ganglia nuclei and the thalamus to frontal areas of cortex, and to motor areas, making it possible for the striatum to influence movement, abstract decision processes, and reward processing. Two main subdivisions of the striatum are important for reinforcement learning: the dorsal striatum, primarily implicated in influencing action selection, and the ventral striatum, thought to be critical for different aspects of reward processing, including the assignment of affective value to sensations."

Axons of cortical neurons influence striatal neurons via corticostriatal synapses releasing the neurotransmitter glutamate at the tips of spines covering the dendrites of striatal neurons. An axon of a VTA or SNpc dopamine neuron is shown passing by the spine (from the lower right). \"Dopamine varicosities\" on this axon release dopamine at or near the spine stem, in an arrangement that brings together presynaptic input from cortex, postsynaptic activity of the striatal neuron, and dopamine, making it possible that several types of learning rules govern the plasticity of corticostriatal synapses. Each axon of a dopamine neuron makes synaptic contact with the stems of roughly 500,000 spines. Some of the complexity omitted from our discussion is shown here by other neurotransmitter pathways and multiple receptor types, such as D1 an D2 dopamine receptors by which dopamine can produce different effects at spines and other postsynaptic sites.

This is surprising because degeneration of dopamine neurons is a cause of Parkinson's disease, whose symptoms include motor disorders, particularly deficits in self- initiated movement. Motivated by the weak relationship between dopamine neuron activity and stimulus- triggered eye and body movements, Romo and Schultz (1990) and Schultz and Romo (1990) took the first steps toward the reward prediction error hypothesis by recording the activity of dopamine neurons and muscle activity while monkeys moved their arms."

The monkey could then grab and bring the food to its mouth. After a monkey became good at this, it was trained on two additional tasks. The purpose of the first task was to see what dopamine neurons do when movements are self- initiated. The bin was left open but covered from above so that the monkey could not see inside but could reach in from below. No triggering stimuli were presented, and after the monkey reached for and ate the food morsel, the experimenter usually (though not always), silently and unseen by the monkey, replaced food in the bin by sticking it onto a rigid wire. Here too, the activity of the dopamine neurons Romo and Schultz monitored was not related to the monkey's movements, but a large percentage of these neurons produced phasic responses whenever the monkey first touched a food morsel. These neurons did not respond when the monkey touched just the wire or explored the bin when no food was there. This was good evidence that the neurons were responding to the food and not to other aspects of the task."

A particular series of experiments was influential in suggesting that the phasic responses of dopamine neurons correspond to TD errors and not to simpler errors like those in the Rescorla- Wagner model (14.3). In the first of these experiments (Ljungberg, Apicella, and Schultz, 1992), monkeys were trained to depress a lever after a light was illuminated as a 'trigger cue' to obtain a drop of apple juice. As Romo and Schultz had observed earlier, many dopamine neurons initially responded to the reward—the drop of juice (Figure 15.2, top panel). But many of these neurons lost that reward response as training continued and developed responses instead to the illumination of the light that predicted the reward (Figure 15.2, middle panel). With continued training, lever pressing became faster while the number of dopamine neurons responding to the trigger cue decreased."

These are plots of the number of action potentials produced by monitored dopamine neurons within small time intervals, averaged over all the monitored dopamine neurons (ranging from 23 to 44 neurons for these data). Top: dopamine neurons are activated by the unpredicted delivery of drop of apple juice. Middle: with learning, dopamine neurons developed responses to the reward-predicting trigger cue and lost responsiveness to the delivery of reward. Bottom: with the addition of an instruction cue preceding the trigger cue by 1 second, dopamine neurons shifted their responses from the trigger cue to the earlier instruction cue.

The monkeys learned to withhold reaching until seeing the trigger cue, and dopamine neuron activity increased, but now the responses of the monitored dopamine neurons occurred almost exclusively to the earlier instruction cue and not to the trigger cue (Figure 15.2, bottom panel). Here again the number of dopamine neurons responding to the instruction cue was much reduced when the task was well learned. During learning across these tasks, dopamine neuron activity shifted from initially responding to the reward to responding to the earlier predictive stimuli, first progressing to the trigger stimulus then to the still earlier instruction cue. As responding moved earlier in time it disappeared from the later stimuli. This shifting of responses to earlier reward predictors, while losing responses to later predictors is a hallmark of TD learning (see, for example, Figure 14.2)."

Top: dopamine neurons are activated by the unpredicted delivery of a drop of apple juice. Middle: dopamine neurons respond to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicts reward and do not respond to the reward itself. Bottom: when the reward predicted by the CS fails to occur, the activity of dopamine neurons drops below baseline shortly after the time the reward is expected to occur. At the top of each of these panels is shown the average number of action potentials produced by monitored dopamine neurons within small time intervals around the indicated times. The raster plots below show the activity patterns of the individual dopamine neurons that were monitored; each dot represents an action potential.

Then its task is just to learn accurate predictions of future reward for the sequence of states it experiences. This is then a prediction task, or more technically, a policy- evaluation task: learning the value function for a fixed policy (Sections 4.1 and 6.1). The value function to be learned assigns to each state a value that predicts the return that will follow that state if the agent selects actions according to the given policy, where the return is the (possibly discounted) sum of all the future rewards. This is unrealistic as a model of the monkey's situation because the monkey would likely learn these predictions at the same time that it is learning to act correctly (as would a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns policies as well as value functions, such as an actor- critic algorithm), but this scenario is simpler to describe than one in which a policy and a value function are learned simultaneously."

Further imagine that the return being predicted is limited to the return over a trial, which makes a trial analogous to a reinforcement learning episode as we have defined it. In reality, of course, the returns being predicted are not confined to single trials, and the time interval between trials is an important factor in determining what an animal learns. This is true for TD learning as well, but here we assume that returns do not accumulate over multiple trials. Given this, then, a trial in experiments like those conducted by Schultz and colleagues is equivalent to an episode of reinforcement learning. (Though in this discussion, we will use the term trial instead of episode to relate better to the experiments.)"

This is like the state near the start of a trial, for example like the state marked by the instruction cue in a trial of the monkey experiment of Schultz et al. (1993) described above. It is the first state in a trial that reliably predicts that trial's reward. (Of course, in reality states visited on preceding trials are even earlier reward- predicting states, but because we are confining predictions to individual trials, these do not qualify as predictors of this trial's reward. Below we give a more satisfactory, though more abstract, description of an earliest reward- predicting state.) The latest reward- predicting state in a trial is the state immediately preceding the trial's rewarding state. This is the state near the far right end of the time line in Figure 15.4. Note that the rewarding state of a trial does not predict the return for that trial: the value of this state would come to predict the return over all the following trials, which here we are assuming to be zero in this episodic formulation."

In the scenario described above, because experience is divided into trials, and we assumed that predictions are confined to individual trials, the earliest reward- predicting state is always the first state of a trial. Clearly this is artificial. A more general way to think of an earliest reward- predicting state is that it is an unpredicted predictor of reward, and there can be many such states. In an animal's life, many different states may precede an earliest reward- predicting state. However, because these states are more often followed by other states that do not predict reward, their reward- predicting powers, that is, their values, remain low. A TD algorithm, if operating throughout the animal's life, would update the values of these states too, but the updates would not consistently accumulate because, by assumption, none of these states reliably precedes an earliest reward- predicting state. If any of them did, they would be reward- predicting states as well. This might explain why with overtraining, dopamine responses decrease to even the earliest reward- predicting stimulus in a trial. With overtraining one would expect that even a formerly- unpredicted predictor state would become predicted by stimuli associated with earlier states: the animal's interaction with its environment both inside and outside of an experimental task would become commonplace. Upon breaking this routine with the introduction of a new task, however, one would see TD errors reappear, as indeed is observed in dopamine neuron activity."

We have seen that the omission of an expected reward produces a negative prediction error at the reward's expected time, which corresponds to the activity of dopamine neurons decreasing below baseline when this happens. If the reward arrives later than expected, it is then an unexpected reward and generates a positive prediction error. This happens with both TD errors and dopamine neuron responses. But when reward arrives earlier than expected, dopamine neurons do not do what the TD error does—at least with the CSC representation used by Montague et al. (1996) and by us in our example.

For instance, to address the early- reward mismatch just described, Suri and Schultz (1999) proposed a CSC representation in which the sequences of internal signals initiated by earlier stimuli are cancelled by the occurrence of a reward. Another proposal by Daw, Courville, and Touretzky (2006) is that the brain's TD system uses representations produced by statistical modeling carried out in sensory cortex rather than simpler representations based on raw sensory input. Ludvig, Sutton, and Kehoe (2008) found that TD learning with a microstimulus (MS) representation (Figure 14.1) fits the activity of dopamine neurons in the early- reward and other situations better than when a CSC representation is used. Pan, Schmidt, Wickerus, and Hyland (2005) found that even with the CSC representation, prolonged eligibility traces improve the fit of the TD error to some aspects of dopamine neuron activity. In general, many fine details of TD- error behavior depend on subtle interactions between eligibility traces, discounting, and stimulus representations. Findings like these elaborate and refine the reward prediction error hypothesis without refuting its core claim that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons is well characterized as signaling TD errors."

But the reward prediction error hypothesis has been functioning very effectively as a catalyst for improving our understanding of how the brain's reward system works. Intricate experiments have been designed to validate or refute predictions derived from the hypothesis, and experimental results have, in turn, led to refinement and elaboration of the TD error/dopamine hypothesis."

First, the two components of an actor- critic algorithm—the actor and the critic—suggest that two parts of the striatum—the dorsal and ventral subdivisions (Section 15.4), both critical for reward- based learning—may function respectively something like an actor and a critic. A second property of actor- critic algorithms that suggests a brain implementation is that the TD error has the dual role of being the reinforcement signal for both the actor and the critic, though it has a different influence on learning in each of these components. This fits well with several properties of the neural circuitry: axons of dopamine neurons target both the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the striatum; dopamine appears to be critical for modulating synaptic plasticity in both structures; and how a neuromodulator such as dopamine acts on a target structure depends on properties of the target structure and not just on properties of the neuromodulator."

We postpone discussion of the actor and critic learning rules until Section 15.8, where we present them as special cases of the policy- gradient formulation and discuss what they suggest about how dopamine might modulate synaptic plasticity."

Recall from Section 15.4 that the dorsal striatum is primarily implicated in influencing action selection, and the ventral striatum is thought to be critical for different aspects of reward processing, including the assignment of affective value to sensations. The cerebral cortex, along with other structures, sends input to the striatum conveying information about stimuli, internal states, and motor activity."

In defining the neuron- like actor and critic units, we ignored the small amount of time it takes synaptic input to effect the firing of a real neuron. When an action potential from the presynaptic neuron arrives at a synapse, neurotransmitter molecules are released that diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic neuron, where they bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron's surface; this activates molecular machinery that causes the postsynaptic neuron to fire (or to inhibit its firing in the case of inhibitory synaptic input). This process can take several tens of milliseconds. According to (15.1) and (15.2), though, the input to a critic and actor unit instantaneously produces the unit's output. Ignoring activation time like this is common in abstract models of Hebbian- style plasticity in which synaptic efficacies change according to a simple product of simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity. More realistic models must take activation time into account."

Neuroscientists have discovered a form of Hebbian plasticity called spike- timing- dependent plasticity (STDP) that lends plausibility to the existence of actor- like synaptic plasticity in the brain. STDP is a Hebbian- style plasticity, but changes in a synapse's efficacy depend on the relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials. The dependence can take different forms, but in the one most studied, a synapse increases in strength if spikes incoming via that synapse arrive shortly before the postsynaptic neuron fires. If the timing relation is reversed, with a presynaptic spike arriving shortly after the postsynaptic neuron fires, then the strength of the synapse decreases. STDP is a type of Hebbian plasticity that takes the activation time of a neuron into account, which is one of the ingredients needed for actor- like learning."

                                    "content": ", is much like the actor learning rule discussed here. Synaptic changes that would be produced by regular STDP only occur if there is neuromodulatory input within a time window after a presynaptic spike is closely followed by a postsynaptic spike. Evidence is accumulating that reward- modulated STDP occurs at the spines of medium spiny neurons of the dorsal striatum, with dopamine providing the neuromodulatory factor—the sites where actor learning takes place in the hypothetical neural implementation of an actor- critic algorithm illustrated in Figure 15.5b. Experiments have demonstrated reward- modulated STDP in which lasting changes in the efficacies of corticostriatal synapses occur only if a neuromodulatory pulse arrives within a time window that can last up to 10 seconds after a presynaptic spike is closely followed by a postsynaptic spike (Yagishita et al. 2014). Although the evidence is indirect, these experiments point to the existence of contingent eligibility traces having prolonged time courses. The molecular mechanisms producing these traces, as well as the much shorter traces that likely underly STDP, are not yet understood, but research focusing on time- dependent and neuromodulator- dependent synaptic plasticity is continuing."

Not all the details of Klopf's hypothesis are consistent with what has been learned about synaptic plasticity, but the discovery of STDP and the growing evidence for a reward- modulated form of STDP suggest that Klopf's ideas may not have been far off the mark. We discuss Klopf's hedonistic neuron hypothesis next."

In other words, individual neurons can be trained with response- contingent reinforcement like an animal can be trained in an instrumental conditioning task. His hypothesis included the idea that rewards and punishments are conveyed to a neuron via the same synaptic input that excites or inhibits the neuron's spike- generating activity. (Had Klopf known what we know today about neuromodulatory systems, he might have assigned the reinforcing role to neuromodulatory input, but he wanted to avoid any centralized source of training information.) Synaptically- local traces of past pre- and postsynaptic activity had the key function in Klopf's hypothesis of making synapses eligible—the term he introduced—for modification by later reward or punishment. He conjectured that these traces are implemented by molecular mechanisms local to each synapse and therefore different from the electrical activity of both the pre- and the postsynaptic neurons. In"

When a neuron fires an action potential, all of its synapses that were active in contributing to that action potential become eligible to undergo changes in their efficacies. If the action potential is followed within an appropriate time period by an increase of reward, the efficacies of all the eligible synapses increase. Symmetrically, if the action potential is followed within an appropriate time period by an increase of punishment, the efficacies of eligible synapses decrease. This is implemented by triggering an eligibility trace at a synapse upon a coincidence of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (or more exactly, upon pairing of presynaptic activity with the postsynaptic activity that that presynaptic activity participates in causing)—what we call a contingent eligibility trace. This is essentially the three- factor learning rule of an actor unit described in the previous section."

His idea was that the shape of a synaptic eligibility trace is like a histogram of the durations of the feedback loops in which the neuron is embedded. The peak of an eligibility trace would then occur at the duration of the most prevalent feedback loops in which that neuron participates. The eligibility traces used by algorithms described in this book are simplified versions of Klopf's original idea, being exponentially (or geometrically) decreasing functions controlled by the parameters "

A well- studied example of a single cell that seeks some stimuli and avoids others is the bacterium Escherichia coli. The movement of this single- cell organism is influenced by chemical stimuli in its environment, behavior known as chemotaxis. It swims in its liquid environment by rotating hairlike structures called flagella attached to its surface. (Yes, it rotates them!) Molecules in the bacterium's environment bind to receptors on its surface. Binding events modulate the frequency with which the bacterium reverses flagellar rotation. Each reversal causes the bacterium to tumble in place and then head off in a random new direction. A little chemical memory and computation causes the frequency of flagellar reversal to decrease when the bacterium swims toward higher concentrations of molecules it needs to survive (attractants) and increase when the bacterium swims toward higher concentrations of molecules that are harmful (repellants). The result is that the bacterium tends to persist in swimming up attractant gradients and tends to avoid swimming up repellant gradients."

Similarly, one might think of a neuron \"swimming\" (not literally of course) in a medium composed of the complex collection of feedback loops in which it is embedded, acting to obtain one type of input signal and to avoid others. Unlike the bacterium, however, the neuron's synaptic strengths retain information about its past trial- and- error behavior. If this view of the behavior of a neuron (or just one type of neuron) is plausible, then the closed- loop nature of how the neuron interacts with its environment is important for understanding its behavior, where the neuron's environment consists of the rest of the animal together with the environment with which the animal as a whole interacts."

He argued that many aspects of intelligent behavior can be understood as the result of the collective behavior of a population of self- interested hedonistic neurons interacting with one another in an immense society or economic system making up an animal's nervous system. Whether or not this view of nervous systems is useful, the collective behavior of reinforcement learning agents has implications for neuroscience. We take up this subject next."

This means that any individual agent has only limited ability to affect the reward signal because any single agent contributes just one component of the collective action evaluated by the common reward signal. Effective learning in this scenario requires addressing a structural credit assignment problem: which team members, or groups of team members, deserve credit for a favorable reward signal, or blame for an unfavorable reward signal? It is a cooperative game, or a team problem, because the agents are united in seeking to increase the same reward signal: there are no conflicts of interest among the agents. The scenario would be a competitive game if different agents receive different reward signals, where each reward signal again evaluates the collective action of the population, and the objective of each agent is to increase its own reward signal. In this case there might be conflicts of interest among the agents, meaning that actions that are good for some agents are bad for others. Even deciding what the best collective action should be is a non- trivial aspect of game theory. This competitive setting might be relevant to neuroscience too (for example, to account for heterogeneity of dopamine neuron activity), but here we focus only on the cooperative, or team, case."

An interesting result is that if each agent can learn effectively despite its reward signal being corrupted by a large amount of noise, and despite its lack of access to complete state information, then the population as a whole will learn to produce collective actions that improve as evaluated by the common reward signal, even when the agents cannot communicate with one another. Each agent faces its own reinforcement learning task in which its influence on the reward signal is deeply buried in the noise created by the influences of other agents. In fact, for any agent, all the other agents are part of its environment because its input, both the part conveying state information and the reward part, depends on how all the other agents are behaving. Furthermore, lacking access to the actions of the other agents, indeed lacking access to the parameters determining their policies, each agent can only partially observe the state of its environment. This makes each team member's learning task very difficult, but if each uses a reinforcement learning algorithm able to increase a reward signal even under these difficult conditions, teams of reinforcement learning agents can learn to produce collective actions that improve over time as evaluated by the team's common reward signal."

A non- contingent eligibility trace, in contrast, is initiated or increased by presynaptic input independently of what the postsynaptic neuron does. As explained in Section 15.8, by keeping information about what actions were taken in what states, contingent eligibility traces allow credit for reward, or blame for punishment, to be apportioned to an agent's policy parameters according to the contribution the values of these parameters made in determining the agent's action. By similar reasoning, a team member must remember its recent action so that it can either increase or decrease the likelihood of producing that action according to the reward signal that is subsequently received. The action component of a contingent eligibility trace implements this action memory. Because of the complexity of the learning task, however, contingent eligibility is merely a preliminary step in the credit assignment process: the relationship between a single team member's action and changes in the team's reward signal is a statistical correlation that has to be estimated over many trials. Contingent eligibility is an essential but preliminary step in this process."

The members of a population of critic- like agents may still receive a common reinforcement signal, but they would all learn to predict the same quantity (which in the case of an actor- critic method, would be the expected return for the current policy). How successful each member of the population would be in learning to predict the expected return would depend on the information it receives, which could be very different for different members of the population.

The simplest way for a team of reinforcement learning agents to do this is for each member to independently explore its own action space through persistent variability in its output. This will cause the team as a whole to vary its collective actions. For example, a team of the actor units described in Section 15.8 explores the space of collective actions because the output of each unit, being a Bernoulli- logistic unit, probabilistically depends on the weighted sum of its input vector's components. The weighted sum biases firing probability up or down, but there is always variability. Because each unit uses a REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm (Chapter 13), each unit adjusts its weights with the goal of maximizing the average reward rate it experiences while stochastically exploring its own action space. One can show, as Williams (1992) did, that a team of Bernoulli- logistic REINFORCE units implements a policy gradient algorithm as a whole with respect to average rate of the team's common reward signal, where the actions are the collective actions of the team."

Results from experiments like these indicate that the actor- critic hypothesis described above is too simple in placing the actor in the dorsal striatum. Inactivating one part of the dorsal striatum, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), impairs habit learning, causing the animal to rely more on goal- directed processes. On the other hand, inactivating the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) impairs goal- directed processes, requiring the animal to rely more on habit learning. Results like these support the view that the DLS in rodents is more involved in model- free processes, whereas their DMS is more involved in model- based processes. Results of"

Specifically implicated is the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the part of the prefrontal cortex immediately above the eyes. Functional neuroimaging in humans, and also recordings of the activities of single neurons in monkeys, reveals strong activity in the OFC related to the subjective reward value of biologically significant stimuli, as well as activity related to the reward expected as a consequence of actions. Although not free of controversy, these results suggest significant involvement of the OFC in goal- directed choice. It may be critical for the reward part of an animal's environment model."

When a rat pauses at a choice point in a maze, the representation of space in the hippocampus sweeps forward (and not backwards) along the possible paths the animal can take from that point (Johnson and Redish, 2007). Furthermore, the spatial trajectories represented by these sweeps closely correspond to the rat's subsequent navigational behavior (Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013). These results suggest that the hippocampus is critical for the state- transition part of an animal's environment model, and that it is part of a system that uses the model to simulate possible future state sequences to assess the consequences of possible courses of action: a form of planning."

For example, how can areas as structurally similar as the DLS and DMS be essential components of modes of learning and behavior that are as different as model- free and model- based algorithms? Are separate structures responsible for (what we call) the transition and reward components of an environment model? Is all planning conducted at decision time via simulations of possible future courses of action as the forward sweeping activity in the hippocampus suggests? In other words, is all planning something like a rollout algorithm (Section 8.10)? Or are models sometimes engaged in the background to refine or recompute value information as illustrated by the Dyna architecture (Section 8.2)? How does the brain arbitrate between the use of the habit and goal- directed systems? Is there, in fact, a clear separation between the neural substrates of these systems?"

One view is that drug craving is the result of the same motivation and learning processes that lead us to seek natural rewarding experiences that serve our biological needs. Addictive substances, by being intensely reinforcing, effectively co- opt our natural mechanisms of learning and decision making. This is plausible given that many- - though not all- - drugs of abuse increase levels of dopamine either directly or indirectly in regions around terminals of dopamine neuron axons in the striatum, a brain structure firmly implicated in normal reward- based learning (Section 15.7). But the self- destructive behavior associated with drug addiction is not characteristic of normal learning. What is different about dopamine- mediated learning when the reward is the result of an addictive drug? Is addiction the result of normal learning in response to substances that were largely unavailable throughout our evolutionary history, so that evolution could not select against their damaging effects? Or do addictive substances somehow interfere with normal dopamine- mediated learning?"

Or the model might be misleading. Dopamine appears not to play a critical role in all forms of addiction, and not everyone is equally susceptible to developing addictive behavior. Moreover, the model does not include the changes in many circuits and brain regions that accompany chronic drug taking, for example, changes that lead to a drug's diminishing effect with repeated use. It is also likely that addiction involves model- based processes. Still, Redish's model illustrates how reinforcement learning theory can be enlisted in the effort to understand a major health problem. In a similar manner, reinforcement learning theory has been influential in the development of the new field of computational psychiatry, which aims to improve understanding of mental disorders through mathematical and computational methods."

Experiments conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s in the laboratory of neuroscientist Wolfram Schultz showed that dopamine neurons respond to rewarding events with substantial bursts of activity, called phasic responses, only if the animal does not expect those events, suggesting that dopamine neurons are signaling reward prediction errors instead of reward itself. Further, these experiments showed that as an animal learns to predict a rewarding event on the basis of preceding sensory cues, the phasic activity of dopamine neurons shifts to earlier predictive cues while decreasing to later predictive cues. This parallels the backing- up effect of the TD error as a reinforcement learning agent learns to predict reward."

In this setting, each synapse has its own eligibility trace that records past activity involving that synapse. The only difference between the actor and critic learning rules is that they use different kinds of eligibility traces: the critic unit's traces are non- contingent because they do not involve the critic unit's output, whereas the actor unit's traces are contingent because in addition to the actor unit's input, they depend on the actor unit's output. In the hypothetical implementation of an actor- critic system in the brain, these learning rules respectively correspond to rules governing plasticity of corticostriatal synapses that convey signals from the cortex to the principal neurons in the dorsal and ventral striatal subdivisions, synapses that also receive inputs from dopamine neurons."

He conjectured that individual neurons seek to obtain reward and to avoid punishment by adjusting the efficacies of their synapses on the basis of rewarding or punishing consequences of their action potentials. A neuron's activity can affect its later input, because the neuron is embedded in many feedback loops, some within the animal's nervous system and body and others passing through the animal's external environment. Klopf's idea of eligibility is that synapses are temporarily marked as eligible for modification if they participated in the neuron's firing (making this the contingent form of eligibility trace). A synapse's efficacy is modified if a reinforcing signal arrives while the synapse is eligible. We alluded to the chemotactic behavior of a bacterium as an example of a single cell that directs its movements in order to seek some molecules and to avoid others."

Research so far points to their being some brain regions more involved in one type of process than the other, but the picture remains unclear because model- free and model- based processes do not appear to be neatly separated in the brain. Many questions remain unanswered. Perhaps most intriguing is evidence that the hippocampus, a structure traditionally associated with spatial navigation and memory, appears to be involved in simulating possible future courses of action as part of an animal's decision- making process. This suggests that it is part of a system that uses an environment model for planning."

This is far from a complete model of addiction, but it illustrates how a computational perspective suggests theories that can be tested with further research.

Most features of reinforcement learning algorithms owe their design to purely computational considerations, but some have been influenced by hypotheses about neural learning mechanisms. Remarkably, as experimental data has accumulated about the brain's reward processes, many of the purely computationally- motivated features of reinforcement learning algorithms are turning out to be consistent with neuroscience data. Other features of computational reinforcement learning, such as eligibility traces and the ability of teams of reinforcement learning agents to learn to act collectively under the influence of a globally- broadcast reinforcement signal, may also turn out to parallel experimental data as neuroscientists continue to unravel the neural basis of reward- based animal learning and behavior."

The hypothesis was first explicitly put forward by Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski (1996). As they stated the hypothesis, it referred to reward prediction errors (RPEs) but not specifically to TD errors; however, their development of the hypothesis made it clear that they were referring to TD errors. The earliest recognition of the TD- error/dopamine connection of which we are aware is that of Montague, Dayan, Nowlan, Pouget, and Sejnowski (1993), who proposed a TD- error- modulated Hebbian learning rule motivated by results on dopamine signaling from Schultz's group. The connection was also pointed out in an abstract by Quartz, Dayan, Montague, and Sejnowski (1992). Montague and Sejnowski (1994) emphasized the importance of prediction in the brain and outlined how predictive Hebbian learning modulated by TD errors could be implemented via a diffuse neuromodulatory system, such as the dopamine system.

Montague, Dayan, Person, and Sejnowski (1995) presented a model of honeybee foraging using the TD error. The model is based on research by Hammer, Menzel, and colleagues (Hammer and Menzel, 1995; Hammer, 1997) showing that the neuromodulator octopamine acts as a reinforcement signal in the honeybee. Montague et al. (1995) pointed out that dopamine likely plays a similar role in the vertebrate brain. Barto (1995a) related the actor- critic architecture to basal- ganglionic circuits and discussed the relationship between TD learning and the main results from Schultz's group. Houk, Adams, and Barto (1995) suggested how TD learning and the actor- critic architecture might map onto the anatomy, physiology, and molecular mechanism of the basal ganglia. Doya and Sejnowski (1998) extended their earlier paper on a model of birdsong learning (Doya and Sejnowski, 1995) by including a TD- like error identified with dopamine to reinforce the selection of auditory input to be memorized. O'Reilly and Frank (2006) and O'Reilly, Frank, Hazy, and Watz (2007) argued that phasic dopamine signals are RPEs but not TD errors. In support of their theory they cited results with variable interstimulus intervals that do not match predictions of a simple TD model, as well as the observation that higher- order conditioning beyond second- order conditioning is rarely observed, while TD learning is not so limited. Dayan and Niv (2008) discussed \"the good, the bad, and the ugly\" of how reinforcement learning theory and the reward prediction error hypothesis align with experimental data.

The experiments mentioned that involve optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons were conducted by Tsai, Zhang, Adamantidis, Stuber, Bonci, de Lecea, and Deisseroth (2009), Steinberg, Keiflin, Boivin, Witten, Deisseroth, and Janak (2013), and Claridge- Chang, Roorda, Vrontou, Sjulson, Li, Hirsh, and Miesenbock (2009). Fiorillo, Yun, and Song (2013), Lammel, Lim, and Malenka (2014), and Saddoris, Cacciapaglia, Wightman, and Carvelli (2015) are among studies showing that the signaling properties of dopamine neurons are specialized for different target regions. RPE- signaling neurons may belong to one among multiple populations of dopamine neurons having different targets and subserving different functions. Eshel, Tian, Bukwich, and Uchida (2016) found homogeneity of reward prediction error responses of dopamine neurons in the lateral VTA during classical conditioning in mice, though their results do not rule out response diversity across wider areas. Gershman, Pesaran, and Daw (2009) studied reinforcement learning tasks that can be decomposed into independent components with separate reward signals, finding evidence in human neuroimaging data suggesting that the brain exploits this kind of structure."

To the best of our knowledge, Barto (1995a) and Houk, Adams, and Barto (1995) first speculated about possible implementations of actor- critic algorithms in the basal ganglia. On the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging of human subjects while engaged in instrumental conditioning, O'Doherty, Dayan, Schultz, Deichmann, Friston, and Dolan (2004) suggested that the actor and the critic are most likely located respectively in the dorsal and ventral striatum. Gershman, Mustafa, and Ludvig (2014) focused on how time is represented in reinforcement learning models of the basal ganglia, discussing evidence for, and implications of, various computational approaches to time representation."

Rao and Sejnowski (2001) suggested how STDP could be the result of a TD- like mechanism at synapses with non- contingent eligibility traces lasting about 10 milliseconds. Dayan (2002) commented that this would require an error as in Sutton and Barto's (1981a) early model of classical conditioning and not a true TD error. Representative publications from the extensive literature on reward- modulated STDP are Wickens (1990), Reynolds and Wickens (2002), and Calabresi, Picconi, Tozzi and Di Filippo (2007). Pawlak and Kerr (2008) showed that dopamine is necessary to induce STDP at the corticostriatal synapses of medium spiny neurons. See also Pawlak, Wickens, Kirkwood, and Kerr (2010). Yagishita, Hayashi- Takagi, Ellis- Davies, Urakubo, Ishii, and Kasai (2014) found that dopamine promotes spine enlargement of the medium spiny neurons of mice only during a time window of from 0.3 to 2 seconds after STDP stimulation. Izhikevich (2007) proposed and explored the idea of using STDP timing conditions to trigger contingent eligibility traces. Frémaux, Sprekeler, and Gerstner (2010) proposed theoretical conditions for successful learning by rules based on reward- modulated STDP."

Ideas related to Klopf's synaptically- local eligibility have been proposed by others. Crow (1968) proposed that changes in the synapses of cortical neurons are sensitive to the consequences of neural activity. Emphasizing the need to address the time delay between neural activity and its consequences in a reward- modulated form of synaptic plasticity, he proposed a contingent form of eligibility, but associated with entire neurons instead of individual synapses.

This is essentially the same as the learning scheme Minsky used in his 1954 Princeton PhD dissertation, where he called the synapse- like learning element a SNARC (Stochastic Neural- Analog Reinforcement Calculator). Contingent eligibility is involved in these ideas too, although it is contingent on the activity of an individual synapse instead of the postsynaptic neuron. Also related is the proposal of Unnikrishnan and Venugopal (1994) that uses the correlation- based method of Harth and Tzanakou (1974) to adjust ANN weights."

The model of O'Reilly and Frank (2006) and O'Reilly, Frank, Hazy, and Watz (2007) uses working memory to bridge temporal intervals instead of eligibility traces. Wickens and Kotter (1995) discuss possible mechanisms for synaptic eligibility. He, Huertas, Hong, Tie, Hell, Shouval, Kirkwood (2015) provide evidence supporting the existence of contingent eligibility traces in synapses of cortical neurons with time courses like those of the eligibility traces Klopf postulated."

To the best of our knowledge, the first phase began with investigations by the Russian mathematician and physicist M. L. Tsetlin. A collection of his work was published as Tsetlin (1973) after his death in 1966. Our Sections 1.7 and 4.8 refer to his study of learning automata in connection to bandit problems. The Tsetlin collection also includes studies of learning automata in team and game problems, which led to later work in this area using stochastic learning automata as described by Narendra and Thathachar (1974, 1989), Viswanathan and Narendra (1974), Lakshmivarshan and Narendra (1982), Narendra and Wheeler (1983), and Thathachar and Sastry (2002). Thathachar and Sastry (2011) is a more recent comprehensive account. These studies were mostly restricted to non- associative learning automata, meaning that they did not address associative, or contextual, bandit problems (Section 2.9)."

The learning algorithm was an associative extension of the Alopex algorithm of Harth and Tzanakou (1974). Barto et al. called neuron- like elements implementing this kind of learning associative search elements (ASEs).

Results of functional imaging experiments with human subjects in the outcome- devaluation setting by Valentin, Dickinson, and O'Doherty (2007) suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is an important component of goal- directed choice. Single unit recordings in monkeys by Padoa- Schioppa and Assad (2006) support the role of the OFC in encoding values guiding choice behavior. Rangel, Camerer, and Montague (2008) and Rangel and Hare (2010) reviewed findings from the perspective of neuroeconomics about how the brain makes goal- directed decisions. Pezzulo, van der Meer, Lansink, and Pennartz (2014) reviewed the neuroscience of internally generated sequences and presented a model of how these mechanisms might be components of model- based planning. Daw and Shohamy (2008) proposed that while dopamine signaling connects well to habitual, or model- free, behavior, other processes are involved in goal- directed, or model- based, behavior. Data from experiments by Bromberg- Martin, Matsumoto, Hong, and Hikosaka (2010) indicate that dopamine signals contain information pertinent to both habitual and goal- directed behavior. Doll, Simon, and Daw (2012) argued that there may not a clear separation in the brain between mechanisms that subserve habitual and goal- directed learning and choice."
