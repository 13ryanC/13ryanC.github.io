These are respectively called model- based and model- free reinforcement learning methods. Model- based methods rely on planning as their primary component, while model- free methods primarily rely on learning. Although there are real differences between these two kinds of methods, there are also great similarities. In particular, the heart of both kinds of methods is the computation of value functions. Moreover, all the methods are based on looking ahead to future events, computing a backed- up value, and then using it as an update target for an approximate value function. Earlier in this book we presented Monte Carlo and temporal- difference methods as distinct alternatives, then showed how they can be unified by "

Some models produce a description of all possibilities and their probabilities; these we call distribution models. Other models produce just one of the possibilities, sampled according to the probabilities; these we call sample models. For example, consider modeling the sum of a dozen dice.

Distribution models are stronger than sample models in that they can always be used to produce samples. However, in many applications it is much easier to obtain sample models than distribution models. The dozen dice are a simple example of this. It would be easy to write a computer program to simulate the dice rolls and return the sum, but harder and more error- prone to figure out all the possible sums and their probabilities."

State- space planning, which includes the approach we take in this book, is viewed primarily as a search through the state space for an optimal policy or an optimal path to a goal. Actions cause transitions from state to state, and value functions are computed over states. In what we call plan- space planning, planning is instead a search through the space of plans. Operators transform one plan into another, and value functions, if any, are defined over the space of plans. Plan- space planning includes evolutionary methods and \"partial- order planning,\" a common kind of planning in artificial intelligence in which the ordering of steps is not completely determined at all stages of planning. Plan- space methods are difficult to apply efficiently to the stochastic sequential decision problems that are the focus in reinforcement learning, and we do not consider them further (but see, e.g., Russell and Norvig, 2010)."

In this chapter we argue that various other state- space planning methods also fit this structure, with individual methods differing only in the kinds of updates they do, the order in which they do them, and in how long the backed- up information is retained.Viewing planning methods in this way emphasizes their relationship to the learning methods that we have described in this book. The heart of both learning and planning methods is the estimation of value functions by backing- up update operations. The difference is that whereas planning uses simulated experience generated by a model, learning methods use real experience generated by the environment. Of course this difference leads to a number of other differences, for example, in how performance is assessed and in how flexibly experience can be generated. But the common structure means that many ideas and algorithms can be transferred between planning and learning. In particular, in many cases a learning algorithm can be substituted for the key update step of a planning method. Learning methods require only experience as input, and in many cases they can be applied to simulated experience just as well as to real experience. The box below shows a simple example of a planning method based on one- step tabular Q- learning and on random samples from a sample model. This method, which we call random- sample one- step tabular "

This enables planning to be interrupted or redirected at any time with little wasted computation, which appears to be a key requirement for efficiently intermixing planning with acting and with learning of the model. Planning in very small steps may be the most efficient approach even on pure planning problems if the problem is too large to be solved exactly."

If decision making and model learning are both computation- intensive processes, then the available computational resources may need to be divided between them. To begin exploring these issues, in this section we present Dyna- Q, a simple architecture integrating the major functions needed in an online planning agent. Each function appears in Dyna- Q in a simple, almost trivial, form. In subsequent sections we elaborate some of the alternate ways of achieving each function and the trade- offs between them. For now, we seek merely to illustrate the ideas and stimulate your intuition."

Indirect methods often make fuller use of a limited amount of experience and thus achieve a better policy with fewer environmental interactions. On the other hand, direct methods are much simpler and are not affected by biases in the design of the model. Some have argued that indirect methods are always superior to direct ones, while others have argued that direct methods are responsible for most human and animal learning. Related debates in psychology and artificial intelligence concern the relative importance of cognition as opposed to trial- and- error learning, and of deliberative planning as opposed to reactive decision making (see Chapter 14 for discussion of some of these issues from the perspective of psychology). Our view is that the contrast between the alternatives in all these debates has been exaggerated, that more insight can be gained by recognizing the similarities between these two sides than by opposing them. For example, in this book we have emphasized the deep similarities between dynamic programming and temporal- difference methods, even though one was designed for planning and the other for model- free learning."

The central column represents the basic interaction between agent and environment, giving rise to a trajectory of real experience. The arrow on the left of the figure represents direct reinforcement learning operating on real experience to improve the value function and the policy. On the right are model- based processes. The model is learned from real experience and gives rise to simulated experience. We use the term search control to refer to the process that selects the starting states and actions for the simulated experiences generated by the model. Finally, planning is achieved by applying reinforcement learning methods to the simulated experiences just as if they had really happened. Typically, as in Dyna- Q, the same reinforcement learning method is used both for learning from real experience and for planning from simulated experience. The reinforcement learning method is thus the \"final common path\" for both learning and planning. Learning and planning are deeply integrated in the sense that they share almost all the same machinery, differing only in the source of their experience."

Because planning proceeds incrementally, it is trivial to intermix planning and acting. Both proceed as fast as they can. The agent is always reactive and always deliberative, responding instantly to the latest sensory information and yet always planning in the background. Also ongoing in the background is the model- learning process. As new information is gained, the model is updated to better match reality. As the model changes, the ongoing planning process will gradually compute a different way of behaving to match the new model."

Initially, there is a short path from start to goal, to the right of the barrier, as shown in the upper left of the figure. After 1000 time steps, the short path is \"blocked,\" and a longer path is opened up along the left- hand side of the barrier, as shown in upper right of the figure. The graph shows average cumulative reward for a Dyna- Q agent and an enhanced Dyna- Q+ agent to be described shortly. The first part of the graph shows that both Dyna agents found the short path within 1000 steps. When the environment changed, the graphs become flat, indicating a period during which the agents obtained no reward because they were wandering around behind the barrier. After a while, however, they were able to find the new opening and the new optimal behavior."

At the beginning of the second episode, only the state- action pair leading directly into the goal has a positive value; the values of all other pairs are still zero. This means that it is pointless to perform updates along almost all transitions, because they take the agent from one zero- valued state to another, and thus the updates would have no effect. Only an update along a transition into the state just prior to the goal, or from it, will change any values. If simulated transitions are generated uniformly, then many wasteful updates will be made before stumbling onto one of these useful ones. As planning progresses, the region of useful updates grows, but planning is still far less efficient than it would be if focused where it would do the most good. In the much larger problems that are our real objective, the number of states is so large that an unfocused search would be extremely inefficient."

Of course, we do not really want to use any methods specific to the idea of \"goal state.\" We want methods that work for general reward functions. Goal states are just a special case, convenient for stimulating intuition. In general, we want to work back not just from goal states but from any state whose value has changed. Suppose that the values are initially correct given the model, as they were in the maze example prior to discovering the goal. Suppose now that the agent discovers a change in the environment and changes its estimated value of one state, either up or down. Typically, this will imply that the values of many other states should also be changed, but the only useful one- step updates are those of actions that lead directly into the one state whose value has been changed. If the values of these actions are updated, then the values of the predecessor states may change in turn. If so, then actions leading into them need to be updated, and then their predecessor states may have changed. In this way one can work backward from arbitrary states that have changed in value, either performing useful updates or terminating the propagation. This general idea might be termed backward focusing of planning computations."

But not all of these will be equally useful. The values of some states may have changed a lot, whereas others may have changed little. The predecessor pairs of those that have changed a lot are more likely to also change a lot. In a stochastic environment, variations in estimated transition probabilities also contribute to variations in the sizes of changes and in the urgency with which pairs need to be updated. It is natural to prioritize the updates according to a measure of their urgency, and perform them in order of priority. This is the idea behind prioritized sweeping. A queue is maintained of every state- action pair whose estimated value would change nontrivially if updated, prioritized by the size of the change. When the top pair in the queue is updated, the effect on each of its predecessor pairs is computed. If the effect is greater than some small threshold, then the pair is inserted in the queue with the new priority (if there is a previous entry of the pair in the queue, then insertion results in only the higher priority entry remaining in the queue). In this way the effects of changes are efficiently propagated backward until quiescence. The full algorithm for the case of deterministic environments is given in the box on the next page."

Sample updates can win because they break the overall backing- up computation into smaller pieces- those corresponding to individual transitions- which then enables it to be focused more narrowly on the pieces that will have the largest impact. This idea was taken to what may be its logical limit in the \"small backups\" introduced by van Seijen and Sutton (2013). These are updates along a single transition, like a sample update, but based on the probability of the transition without sampling, as in an expected update. By selecting the order in which small updates are done it is possible to greatly improve planning efficiency beyond that possible with prioritized sweeping."

In this section we have emphasized backward focusing, but this is just one strategy. For example, another would be to focus on states according to how easily they can be reached from the states that are visited frequently under the current policy, which might be called forward focusing. Peng and Williams (1993) and Barto, Bradtke and Singh (1995) have explored versions of forward focusing, and the methods introduced in the next few sections take it to an extreme form."

In a real problem, the values of the successor states would be estimates that are themselves updated. By causing estimates to be more accurate sooner, sample updates will have a second advantage in that the values backed up from the successor states will be more accurate. These results suggest that sample updates are likely to be superior to expected updates on problems with large stochastic branching factors and too many states to be solved exactly."

In many tasks the vast majority of the states are irrelevant because they are visited only under very poor policies or with very low probability. Exhaustive sweeps implicitly devote equal time to all parts of the state space rather than focusing where it is needed. As we discussed in Chapter 4, exhaustive sweeps and the equal treatment of all states that they imply are not necessary properties of dynamic programming. In principle, updates can be distributed any way one likes (to assure convergence, all states or state- action pairs must be visited in the limit an infinite number of times; although an exception to this is discussed in Section 8.7 below), but in practice exhaustive sweeps are often used."

One could sample uniformly, as in the Dyna- Q agent, but this would suffer from some of the same problems as exhaustive sweeps. More appealing is to distribute updates according to the on- policy distribution, that is, according to the distribution observed when following the current policy. One advantage of this distribution is that it is easily generated; one simply interacts with the model, following the current policy. In an episodic task, one starts in a start state (or according to the starting- state distribution) and simulates until the terminal state. In a continuing task, one starts anywhere and just keeps simulating. In either case, sample state transitions and rewards are given by the model, and sample actions are given by the current policy. In other words, one simulates explicit individual trajectories and performs updates at the state or state- action pairs encountered along the way. We call this way of generating experience and updates trajectory sampling."

If one had an explicit representation of the on- policy distribution, then one could sweep through all states, weighting the update of each according to the on- policy distribution, but this leaves us again with all the computational costs of exhaustive sweeps. Possibly one could sample and update individual state- action pairs from the distribution, but even if this could be done efficiently, what benefit would this provide over simulating trajectories? Even knowing the on- policy distribution in an explicit form is unlikely. The distribution changes whenever the policy changes, and computing the distribution requires computation comparable to a complete policy evaluation. Consideration of such other possibilities makes trajectory sampling seem both efficient and elegant."

For example, if you are learning to play chess, you study positions that might arise in real games, not random positions of chess pieces. The latter may be valid states, but to be able to accurately value them is a different skill from evaluating positions in real games. We will also see in Part II that the on- policy distribution has significant advantages when function approximation is used. Whether or not function approximation is used, one might expect on- policy focusing to significantly improve the speed of planning."

The quality of the policies found is plotted as a function of the number of expected updates completed. In all cases, sampling according to the on- policy distribution resulted in faster planning initially and retarded planning in the long run. The effect was stronger, and the initial period of faster planning was longer, at smaller branching factors. In other experiments, we found that these effects also became stronger as the number of states increased. For example, the lower part of the figure shows results for a branching factor of 1 for tasks with 10,000 states. In this case the advantage of on- policy focusing is large and long- lasting."

In the long run, focusing on the on- policy distribution may hurt because the commonly occurring states all already have their correct values. Sampling them is useless, whereas sampling other states may actually perform some useful work. This presumably is why the exhaustive, unfocused approach does better in the long run, at least for small problems. These results are not conclusive because they are only for problems generated in a particular, random way, but they do suggest that sampling according to the on- policy distribution can be a great advantage for large problems, in particular for problems in which a small subset of the state- action space is visited under the on- policy distribution."

RTDP updates the values of states visited in actual or simulated trajectories by means of expected tabular value- iteration updates as defined by (4.10). It is basically the algorithm that produced the on- policy results shown in Figure 8.8."

This can be done, for example, by using exploring starts (Section 5.3). This is true for RTDP as well: for episodic tasks with exploring starts, RTDP is an asynchronous value- iteration algorithm that converges to optimal policies for discounted finite MDPs (and for the undiscounted case under certain conditions). Unlike the situation for a prediction problem, it is generally not possible to stop updating any state or state- action pair if convergence to an optimal policy is important."

This focus became increasingly narrow as learning continued. Because the convergence theorem for RTDP applies to the simulations, we know that RTDP eventually would have focused only on relevant states, i.e., on states making up optimal paths.

The simplest, and almost degenerate, example of this use of planning is when only state values are available, and an action is selected by comparing the values of model- predicted next states for each action (or by comparing the values of afterstates as in the tic- tac- toe example in Chapter 1). More generally, planning used in this way can look much deeper than one- step- ahead and evaluate action choices leading to many different predicted state and reward trajectories. Unlike the first use of planning, here planning focuses on a particular state. We call this decision- time planning."

It is just that now the values and policy are specific to the current state and the action choices available there, so much so that the values and policy created by the planning process are typically discarded after being used to select the current action. In many applications this is not a great loss because there are very many states and we are unlikely to return to the same state for a long time. In general, one may want to do a mix of both: focus planning on the current state and store the results of planning so as to be that much farther along should one return to the same state later. Decision- time planning is most useful in applications in which fast responses are not required. In chess playing programs, for example, one may be permitted seconds or minutes of computation for each move, and strong programs may plan dozens of moves ahead within this time. On the other hand, if low latency action selection is the priority, then one is generally better off doing planning in the background to compute a policy that can then be rapidly applied to each newly encountered state."

For example, to compute the greedy action given a model and a state- value function, we must look ahead from each possible action to each possible next state, take into account the rewards and estimated values, and then pick the best action. Just as in conventional heuristic search, this process computes backed- up values of the possible actions, but does not attempt to save them. Thus, heuristic search can be viewed as an extension of the idea of a greedy policy beyond a single step."

On the other hand, the deeper the search, the more computation is required, usually resulting in a slower response time. A good example is provided by Tesauro's grandmaster- level backgammon player, TD- Gammon (Section 16.1). This system used TD learning to learn an afterstate value function through many games of self- play, using a form of heuristic search to make its moves. As a model, TD- Gammon used a priori knowledge of the probabilities of dice rolls and the assumption that the opponent always selected the actions that TD- Gammon rated as best for it. Tesauro found that the deeper the heuristic search, the better the moves made by TD- Gammon, but the longer it took to make each move. Backgammon has a large branching factor, yet moves must be made within a few seconds. It was only feasible to search ahead selectively a few steps, but even so the search resulted in significantly better action selections."

No matter how you select actions, it is these states and actions that are of highest priority for updates and where you most urgently want your approximate value function to be accurate. Not only should your computation be preferentially devoted to imminent events, but so should your limited memory resources. In chess, for example, there are far too many possible positions to store distinct value estimates for each of them, but chess programs based on heuristic search can easily store distinct estimates for the millions of positions they encounter"

As a limiting case we might use exactly the methods of heuristic search to construct a search tree, and then perform the individual, one- step updates from bottom up, as suggested by Figure 8.9. If the updates are ordered in this way and a tabular representation is used, then exactly the same overall update would be achieved as in depth- first heuristic search. Any state- space search can be viewed in this way as the piecing together of a large number of individual one- step updates. Thus, the performance improvement observed with deeper searches is not due to the use of multistep updates as such. Instead, it is due to the focus and concentration of updates on states and actions immediately downstream from the current state. By devoting a large amount of computation specifically relevant to the candidate actions, decision- time planning can produce better decisions than can be produced by relying on unfocused updates."

Experience has shown that rollout algorithms can be surprisingly effective. For example, Tesauro and Galperin (1997) were surprised by the dramatic improvements in backgammon playing ability produced by the rollout method. In some applications, a rollout algorithm can produce good performance even if the rollout policy is completely random. But the performance of the improved policy depends on properties of the rollout policy and the ranking of actions produced by the Monte Carlo value estimates. Intuition suggests that the better the rollout policy and the more accurate the value estimates, the better the policy produced by a rollout algorithm is likely be (but see Gelly and Silver, 2007)."

It is also possible, as Tesauro and Galperin (1997) suggest, to monitor the Monte Carlo simulations and prune away candidate actions that are unlikely to turn out to be the best, or whose values are close enough to that of the current best that choosing them instead would make no real difference (though Tesauro and Galperin point out that this would complicate a parallel implementation)."

However, these algorithms take advantage of some of the features of reinforcement learning that we have emphasized in this book. As instances of Monte Carlo control, they estimate action values by averaging the returns of a collection of sample trajectories, in this case trajectories of simulated interactions with a sample model of the environment. In this way they are like reinforcement learning algorithms in avoiding the exhaustive sweeps of dynamic programming by trajectory sampling, and in avoiding the need for distribution models by relying on sample, instead of expected, updates. Finally, rollout algorithms take advantage of the policy improvement property by acting greedily with respect to the estimated action values."

At its base, MCTS is a rollout algorithm as described above, but enhanced by the addition of a means for accumulating value estimates obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations in order to successively direct simulations toward more highly- rewarding trajectories. MCTS is largely responsible for the improvement in computer Go from a weak amateur level in 2005 to a grandmaster level (6 dan or more) in 2015. Many variations of the basic algorithm have been developed, including a variant that we discuss in Section 16.6 that was critical for the stunning 2016 victories of the program AlphaGo over an 18- time world champion Go player. MCTS has proved to be effective in a wide variety of competitive settings, including general game playing (e.g., see Finnsson and Björnsson, 2008; Genesereth and Thielscher, 2014), but it is not limited to games; it can be effective for single- agent sequential decision problems if there is an environment model simple enough for fast multistep simulation."

When both the rollout policy and the model do not require a lot of computation, many simulated trajectories can be generated in a short period of time. As in any tabular Monte Carlo method, the value of a state- action pair is estimated as the average of the (simulated) returns from that pair. Monte Carlo value estimates are maintained only for the subset of state- action pairs that are most likely to be reached in a few steps, which form a tree rooted at the current state, as illustrated in Figure 8.10. MCTS incrementally extends the tree by adding nodes representing states that look promising based on the results of the simulated trajectories. Any simulated trajectory will pass through the tree and then exit it at some leaf node. Outside the tree and at the leaf nodes the rollout policy is used for action selections, but at the states inside the tree something better is possible. For these states we have value estimates for at least some of the actions, so we can pick among them using an informed policy, called the tree policy, that balances exploration"

Figure 8.10 illustrates this by showing a backup from the terminal state of the simulated trajectory directly to the state-action node in the tree where the rollout policy began (though in general, the entire return over the simulated trajectory is backed up to this state-action node)."

This is the action MCTS actually selects. After the environment transitions to a new state, MCTS is run again, sometimes starting with a tree of a single root node representing the new state, but often starting with a tree containing any descendants of this node left over from the tree constructed by the previous execution of MCTS; all the remaining nodes are discarded, along with the action values associated with them."

It therefore benefits from online, incremental, sample- based value estimation and policy improvement. Beyond this, it saves action- value estimates attached to the tree edges and updates them using reinforcement learning's sample updates. This has the effect of focusing the Monte Carlo trials on trajectories whose initial segments are common to high- return trajectories previously simulated. Further, by incrementally expanding the tree, MCTS effectively grows a lookup table to store a partial action- value function, with memory allocated to the estimated values of state- action pairs visited in the initial segments of high- yielding sample trajectories. MCTS thus avoids the problem of globally approximating an action- value function while it retains the benefit of using past experience to guide exploration.The striking success of decision- time planning by MCTS has deeply influenced artificial intelligence, and many researchers are studying modifications and extensions of the basic procedure for use in both games and single- agent applications."

A distribution model consists of the probabilities of next states and rewards for possible actions; a sample model produces single transitions and rewards generated according to these probabilities. Dynamic programming requires a distribution model because it uses expected updates, which involve computing expectations over all the possible next states and rewards. A sample model, on the other hand, is what is needed to simulate interacting with the environment during which sample updates, like those used by many reinforcement learning algorithms, can be used. Sample models are generally much easier to obtain than distribution models."

Both involve estimating the same value functions, and in both cases it is natural to update the estimates incrementally, in a long series of small backing- up operations. This makes it straightforward to integrate learning and planning processes simply by allowing both to update the same estimated value function. In addition, any of the learning methods can be converted into planning methods simply by applying them to simulated (model- generated) experience rather than to real experience. In this case learning and planning become even more similar; they are possibly identical algorithms operating on two different sources of experience."

Another important dimension is the distribution of updates, that is, of the focus of search. Prioritized sweeping focuses backward on the predecessors of states whose values have recently changed. On- policy trajectory sampling focuses on states or state- action pairs that the agent is likely to encounter when controlling its environment. This can allow computation to skip over parts of the state space that are irrelevant to the prediction or control problem. Real- time dynamic programming, an on- policy trajectory sampling version of value iteration, illustrates some of the advantages this strategy has over conventional sweep- based policy iteration."

In it we have tried to present reinforcement learning not as a collection of individual methods, but as a coherent set of ideas cutting across methods. Each idea can be viewed as a dimension along which methods vary. The set of such dimensions spans a large space of possible methods. By exploring this space at the level of dimensions we hope to obtain the broadest and most lasting understanding. In this section we use the concept of dimensions in method space to recapitulate the view of reinforcement learning developed so far in this book."

These three ideas are central to the subjects covered in this book. We suggest that value functions, backing up value updates, and GPI are powerful organizing principles potentially relevant to any model of intelligence, whether artificial or natural."

These dimensions have to do with the kind of update used to improve the value function. The horizontal dimension is whether they are sample updates (based on a sample trajectory) or expected updates (based on a distribution of possible trajectories). Expected updates require a distribution model, whereas sample updates need only a sample model, or can be done from actual experience with no model at all (another dimension of variation). The vertical dimension of Figure 8.11 corresponds to the depth of updates, that is, to the degree of bootstrapping. At three of the four corners of the space are the three primary methods for estimating values: dynamic programming, TD, and Monte Carlo. Along the left edge of the space are the sample- update methods,"

The lower- right corner is the extreme case of expected updates so deep that they run all the way to terminal states (or, in a continuing task, until discounting has reduced the contribution of any further rewards to a negligible level). This is the case of exhaustive search. Intermediate methods along this dimension include heuristic search and related methods that search and update up to a limited depth, perhaps selectively. There are also methods that are intermediate along the horizontal dimension. These include methods that mix expected and sample updates, as well as the possibility of methods that mix samples and distributions within a single update.

For example, Dyna methods use both real and simulated experience to affect the same value function.

These dimensions do, however, constitute a coherent set of ideas for describing and exploring a wide space of possible methods."

The authors were also strongly influenced by psychological studies of latent learning (Tolman, 1932) and by psychological views of the nature of thought (e.g., Galanter and Gerstenhaber, 1956; Craik, 1943; Campbell, 1960; Dennett, 1978). In Part III of the book, Section 14.6 relates model- based and model- free methods to psychological theories of learning and behavior, and Section 15.11 discusses ideas about how the brain might implement these types of methods."

The Dyna architecture is due to Sutton (1990), and the results in this and the next section are based on results reported there. Barto and Singh (1990) consider some of the issues in comparing direct and indirect reinforcement learning methods. Early work extending Dyna to linear function approximation was done by Sutton, Szepesvári, Geramifard, and Bowling (2008) and by Parr, Li, Taylor, Painter- Wakefield, and Littman (2008)."

Beyond LRTA*, RTDP includes the option of updating the values of many states in the time intervals between the execution of actions. Barto et al. (1995) proved the convergence result described here by combining Korf's (1990) convergence proof for LRTA* with the result of Bertsekas (1982) (also Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1989) ensuring convergence of asynchronous DP for stochastic shortest path problems in the undiscounted case. Combining model- learning with RTDP is called *Adaptive RTDP*, also presented by Barto et al. (1995) and discussed by Barto (2011)."

Bertsekas, Tsitsiklis, and Wu (1997) examine rollout algorithms applied to combinatorial optimization problems, and Bertsekas (2013) surveys their use in discrete deterministic optimization problems, remarking that they are \"often surprisingly effective.\""

They built upon previous research with Monte Carlo planning algorithms as reviewed by these authors. Browne, Powley, Whitehouse, Lucas, Cowling, Rohlfshagen, Tavener, Perez, Samothrakis, and Colton (2012) is an excellent survey of MCTS methods and their applications. David Silver contributed to the ideas and presentation in this section."
