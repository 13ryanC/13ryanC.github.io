# Foundations Module

This module covers the fundamental concepts and mathematical foundations required to understand reinforcement learning theory. Start here before moving to more advanced topics.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Core Mathematical Concepts
- **Sequential Decision Processes** (`sequential_decision_processes.md`)
  - Introduction to decision-making over time
  - MDPs and basic formulations
  - Bellman equations and optimality

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems Basics
- **MAS/** - Basic multi-agent system concepts
  - Mechanism design fundamentals
  - Agent interaction models

### 3. Philosophical and Theoretical Foundations
- **OaK/** - Open and Known (OaK) concepts
  - Big World Hypothesis
  - Reward Hypothesis
  - Non-stationarity considerations
  - Fundamental assumptions in RL

## Prerequisites
- Linear algebra and probability theory
- Basic optimization concepts
- Familiarity with Markov chains

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to:
- **Algorithms Module** - Core RL algorithms and implementations
- **Theory Module** - Sample complexity and convergence analysis
- **Multi-Agent Module** - Advanced multi-agent concepts

## Key Takeaways
By the end of this module, you should understand:
1. The mathematical framework of sequential decision making
2. Basic multi-agent system concepts
3. Fundamental assumptions and philosophical considerations in RL
4. The relationship between single-agent and multi-agent decision making
