# Advanced Module

This module covers sophisticated RL methods including policy optimization, distributional approaches, and modern deep learning techniques.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Policy Optimization
- **Policy Gradients** (`policy_gradients.md`)
  - Convergence and geometry of PG methods
  - Gradient domination and linear convergence
  - Natural policy gradients
  - Variance reduction techniques

### 2. Regularized and Robust Methods
- **Entropy Regularized RL** (`entropy_regularised_RL.md`)
  - KL-regularized Bellman operators
  - Mirror descent view of RL
  - Soft Actor-Critic connections
  - Convex duality in RL

### 3. Distributional Approaches
- **Distributional RL** (`distributional_RL/`)
  - Complete probability distributions over returns
  - Wasserstein contractions
  - Categorical (C51) and quantile methods
  - Risk-sensitive decision making
  - Multiple detailed files covering theory and practice

### 4. Connections to Multi-Agent Learning
- See **Multi-Agent Primer** (`../multi-agent/primer/index.md`) for prerequisites and modeling assumptions
- Explore **Multi-Agent Advanced** (`../multi-agent/advanced/index.md`) for CTDE, opponent modeling, and deep MARL templates
- Theoretical guarantees covered in **Theory Module** (`../theory/learning_dynamics_convergence.md`) complement these advanced practices

## Prerequisites
- **Algorithms Module** completed
- **Theory Module** recommended for convergence analysis
- Deep learning fundamentals
- Advanced probability and optimization

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. Beyond Expected Returns
- Risk-sensitive objectives
- Distributional perspectives

- Gradient domination properties
- Local vs global optimization

### 3. Modern Deep RL

- Representation learning
- Transfer and meta-learning

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Computational Complexity**: Advanced methods often require more resources
2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: More sophisticated tuning required
3. **Stability**: Understanding when and why methods fail
4. **Empirical Validation**: Theory vs practice gaps

## Research Frontiers
