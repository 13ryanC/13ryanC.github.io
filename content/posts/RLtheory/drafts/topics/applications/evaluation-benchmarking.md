## 8. Evaluation and Benchmarking

**Algorithm Assessment**
- Which properties and learning abilities do we want to test in a MARL algorithm?
- Can the algorithm reliably converge to the desired solution concept on this task?
- Will this benchmark expose generalisation rather than over‑fitting?

**Environment Design**
- Is the state/action space sufficiently rich (or purposely minimal) for the question we care about?
- How dense or sparse is the reward signal—and is that desirable?
- Which high‑level skills (co‑operation, communication, role allocation, etc.) does the environment demand?
- Does the environment offer a scalable ladder of task variants? (agent count, map size, observability radius, etc.)?

**Validation and Resources**
- Are ground‑truth solutions available or at least testable?
- Do we have the practical resources (software, compute, licences) to run this environment at scale?
