## 2. Game Theory and Solution Concepts

**Equilibrium Existence and Uniqueness**
- What does it mean for agents to interact optimally in a multi-agent system? In other words, is a solution guaranteed to exist?
- For a given game model and solution concept, is a solution guaranteed to exist?
- Is the solution unique, or could there be many (even infinitely many) solutions?
- Which equilibrium concept should we shoot for?

**Equilibrium Selection and Coordination**
- When many equilibria exist, which one should agents adopt, and how can they agree on it?
- If several equilibria exist, which one will we end up at? (the equilibrium-selection dilemma)
- What if equilibrium requires randomising?

**Computational Complexity**
- How hard is it, computationally, to compute an equilibrium?
- Do algorithms exist that can compute equilibria efficiently (i.e., polynomial time)?
- Can we learn game solutions instead of computing them from a model?
