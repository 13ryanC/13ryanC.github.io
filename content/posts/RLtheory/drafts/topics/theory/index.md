# Theory Module

This module provides the theoretical foundations for understanding sample complexity, convergence guarantees, and performance bounds in reinforcement learning.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Sample Complexity Theory
- **PAC-MDP Framework** (`PAC-MDP.md`)
  - Probably Approximately Correct learning in MDPs
  - Sample complexity bounds
  - Information-theoretic limits
  - Horizon dependencies and optimal bounds

### 2. Online Learning and Regret
- **Regret Minimization** (`regret_minimisation.md`)
  - Cumulative regret in online RL
  - UCRL2 and confidence-based methods
  - Lower bounds and optimality
  - Variance-aware approaches

### 3. Off-Policy Learning Theory
- **Off-Policy Evaluation** (`OPE.md`)
  - Counterfactual estimation
  - Importance sampling and doubly robust methods
  - Minimax bounds for OPE
  - Representation-based approaches

### 4. State Representation Theory
- **State Abstraction and Bisimulation** (`state_abstraction_bisimulation.md`)
  - Bisimulation metrics and equivalence
  - Value-preserving abstractions
  - Representation learning theory
  - Connection to contrastive learning

### 5. Multi-Agent Theory
- **Solution Concepts** (`solution_concepts_equilibrium.md`)
  - Nash equilibria in games
  - Correlated equilibria
  - Stackelberg equilibria
  - Mechanism design principles

- **Learning Dynamics** (`learning_dynamics_convergence.md`)
