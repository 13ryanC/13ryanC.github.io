# Multi-Agent Advanced

This track covers state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning methods that build on the primer. Topics emphasize centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), opponent modeling, and deep function approximation.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
- **Centralized vs Decentralized** ([draft](../../../drafts/topics/multi-agent-rl/centralized-decentralized.md))
  - CTDE paradigms and design trade-offs
  - Communication protocols and synchronization
  - Scalability and failure modes

### 2. Deep Function Approximation
- **Deep Function Approximation for MARL** ([draft](../../../drafts/topics/multi-agent-rl/deep-function-approximation.md))
  - Neural architectures for multi-agent critics
  - Stability considerations under partial observability
  - Representation learning and shared encoders

### 3. Opponent and Teammate Modeling
- **Algorithmic Templates & Opponent Modeling** ([draft](../../../drafts/topics/multi-agent-rl/opponent-modeling.md))
  - Meta-learning for adaptive strategies
  - Modeling heterogeneous teams and adversaries
  - Curriculum design for emergent behaviours

## Prerequisites
- **Multi-Agent Primer** completed
- Familiarity with policy gradients and value-based deep RL (see **Advanced Module**)
- Comfort with probabilistic graphical models and optimization

## Next Steps
- Dive into **Theory Module** topics on learning dynamics and equilibrium guarantees
- Apply techniques in the **Applications Module** to domains like robotics swarms and strategic games
- Explore **drafts/** for in-progress research ideas and forthcoming chapters

## Cross-References
- `../../advanced/policy_gradients.md` – Gradient methods shared with single-agent deep RL
- `../../theory/learning_dynamics_convergence.md` – Convergence analysis for multi-agent learning
- `../../applications/evaluation_benchmarking.md` – Benchmarking multi-agent systems

## Key Takeaways
1. CTDE frameworks align theoretical guarantees with deployable architectures.
2. Deep function approximation must address non-stationarity induced by co-learning agents.
3. Opponent modeling closes the loop between theory and practice, enabling adaptive and robust MARL deployments.
