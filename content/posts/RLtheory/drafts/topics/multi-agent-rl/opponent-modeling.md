## 4. Algorithmic Approaches and Opponent Modeling

**Strategic Considerations**
- Is modelling opponents better than worst‑case assumptions?
- How much is it worth to probe another agent?
- Can one generic template cover all these algorithms?

**Scaling and Tractability**
- How do we keep learning tractable when the number of agents grows? (the scaling question)
- How well does the algorithm scale with the number of agents?
