## 1. Introduction: Beyond Expected Returns

Classical reinforcement learning focuses on learning expected returns—single scalar values that represent the average future reward from each state. However, this approach fundamentally limits our understanding of the underlying decision-making environment. When we compress the entire future reward distribution into a single number, we lose critical information about risk, uncertainty, and the shape of possible outcomes.

**Distributional reinforcement learning** addresses this limitation by learning the complete probability distribution of future returns rather than just their expected values. This paradigm shift enables agents to make more informed decisions by considering the full spectrum of possible outcomes, not just their averages.

## 2. The Fundamental Problem with Expectations

### Why Averages Can Mislead

The expectation operator \(\mathbb{E}\) is inherently many-to-one: different probability distributions can share identical means while having vastly different shapes, variances, and tail behaviors. This information loss becomes problematic when the distribution's shape drives optimal decision-making.

Formally, let the *return* be the random variable \(G = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^{t} R_t\) with law \(\mathcal{G}\) on \(\mathbb{R}\). Different distributions that share the same mean collapse to the same value estimate \(V = \mathbb{E}[G]\). Whenever the *shape* of \(\mathcal{G}\) (variance, skew, multimodality, tail mass) drives good decisions, the scalar \(V\) becomes a lossy—and potentially dangerous—summary.

### Problem Archetypes Where Expectations Fail

Several common scenarios expose the limitations of expectation-based approaches:

| # | Archetype | Why the Mean Fails | Real-World Examples |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Binary-extreme outcomes** | Mean sits between two modes and suggests "mild profit" although most trajectories are bad | • Gambling & lotteries<br>• Early-stage drug discovery (rare blockbuster hit)<br>• Exploration-heavy RL domains like Montezuma's Revenge where ≥90% roll-outs score 0 but rare ones score very high |
| **2** | **Catastrophe vs. nominal operation** | A tiny crash probability adds a large negative tail; \(\mathbb{E}[G]\) can still be positive, masking fatal risk | • Autonomous driving or drone flight (0.1% collision rate)<br>• Robotic manipulation near fragile objects<br>• Nuclear power shutdown policies |
| **3** | **Heavy-tailed cost or reward** | Variance is infinite or huge; the sample mean converges slowly and underestimates risk | • High-frequency trading P&L<br>• Network traffic surges causing queue overflow<br>• Insurance claim sizes |
| **4** | **Threshold or draw-down constraints** | Decision quality depends on staying above a wealth/energy/health barrier, a property of the lower tail, not the mean | • Portfolio management with Value-at-Risk limits<br>• Battery-powered robot that must not deplete charge mid-mission<br>• Inventory control with stock-out penalties |
| **5** | **Multi-modal strategy payoffs** | Averaging distinct modes gives a value that no single policy ever achieves; policy ranking becomes unreliable | • Poker variants<br>• Multi-agent coordination tasks with "win together/lose together" outcomes<br>• Curriculum-learning environments with disparate sub-tasks |
| **6** | **Asymmetric loss functions** | When the user's utility \(u(\cdot)\) is convex or concave, maximizing \(\mathbb{E}[G] \neq\) maximizing \(\mathbb{E}[u(G)]\) | • Risk-averse health-care dosing (quadratic penalty for overdosing)<br>• Risk-seeking advertising bids (concave gain for clicks) |
| **7** | **Sparse-reward or rare-event learning** | Expectation is near zero for long stretches, providing almost no learning signal even though informative tail events exist | • Goal-conditioned robotic pick-and-place<br>• Hard-exploration Atari games<br>• Cyber-security intrusion detection |

### Recognizing Risk-Sensitive Tasks in Practice

| Indicator in Data/Model | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Histogram or kernel density of returns shows multiple modes, heavy skew, or fat tails | Direct evidence that the mean is unrepresentative |
| Empirical variance or CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) is large relative to \(\mathbb{E}[G]\) | Tail behavior dominates utility |
| Small policy tweaks change higher-order moments (probability of failure) while leaving the mean nearly unchanged | Performance depends on distribution shape |
| Domain requirements mention "safety", "risk", "guarantees", "worst-case", "draw-down", "tail-probability" | Stakeholders already care about risk-sensitive criteria |

### Why Distributional RL Addresses These Archetypes

1. **Tail-aware optimization** – Policies can be chosen to minimize CVaR, variance, or crash probability directly once \(\mathcal{G}\) is learned.

2. **Rich exploration signals** – High quantiles or entropy of \(\mathcal{G}\) guide curiosity toward rare but valuable states.

3. **One-shot re-use** – A single learned distribution supports multiple downstream utilities without retraining (e.g., switching from risk-neutral to risk-averse planning).

### Practical Checklist Before Modeling Only the Mean

| Question | If answer is "yes", consider distributional RL |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Could a low-probability event have large positive *or* catastrophic impact? | ✓ |
| Does the task include hard constraints or safety margins? | ✓ |
| Are rewards sparse/highly skewed? | ✓ |
| Will different stakeholders evaluate the same policy under different risk preferences? | ✓ |

## 3. The Distributional Perspective

### Fundamental Distinction

| Aspect | Classical RL | Distributional RL |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Quantity modeled** | **Expected return** \(V^\pi(x) = \mathbb{E}[G^\pi \mid X=x]\) – a single scalar per state | **Return distribution** \(\mathcal{G}^\pi(x) = \text{Law}[G^\pi \mid X=x]\) – a full probability law (infinite-dimensional) |
| **Bellman relation** | Scalar Bellman equation | *Distributional* Bellman equation \(G^\pi(x) \overset{D}{=} R + \gamma G^\pi(X')\) |
| **Objective implied** | Maximize expectation → *risk-neutral* policy | Can optimize arbitrary risk functionals of \(\mathcal{G}\) (variance, CVaR, etc.) → *risk-sensitive/robust* policies |
| **Error metric** | \(L^1\)/\(L^2\) norm between scalars | Probability metrics between distributions (Wasserstein, KL, Cramér) |
| **Representation** | A table or function approximator for \(V\) or \(Q\) | A parametric family for \(\mathcal{G}\) (categorical "C51", quantile "QR-DQN", mixture models, particles) |
| **Learning difficulty** | Single target per sample | Target *distribution* must be projected/approximated → heavier computation, stability issues |

### Mathematical Foundation

**Finite discounted MDP** \(M = (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)\) with \(\gamma \in (0,1)\).

For a stationary policy \(\pi\):

**Return random variable:**
$$G^\pi_{x,a} = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t, \quad R_t \sim R(X_t, A_t), \quad X_{t+1} \sim P(\cdot|X_t, A_t), \quad A_t \sim \pi(\cdot|X_t)$$

**Return distribution:** \(\mathcal{Z}^\pi_{x,a} = \mathbb{P}(G^\pi_{x,a}) = \text{Law}(G^\pi_{x,a}) \in \mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R})\) (probability measures with finite first moment).

**Distributional Bellman Operator:**

$$
(\mathcal T^\pi \mathcal Z)_{x,a} = \text{Law}(R(x,a) + \gamma \mathcal Z_{X',A'})
$$

where \(X' \sim P(\cdot|x,a)\) and \(A' \sim \pi(\cdot|X')\).

**Theorem 1 (Bellemare-Dabney-Munos 2017):** For any \(p \geq 1\), the operator \(\mathcal{T}^\pi\) is a \(\gamma\)-contraction in the \(p\)-Wasserstein metric \(W_p\):
$$W_p(\mathcal{T}^\pi \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{T}^\pi \mathcal{Z}') \leq \gamma W_p(\mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{Z}')$$

Hence a unique fixed point \(\mathcal{Z}^{\pi*}\) exists.

### Relationship to Classical RL

**Proposition 1:** *The expectation functional is a surjective homomorphism from the space of distributional fixed points onto the space of classical value functions.*

Taking expectations on both sides of the distributional fixed-point equation:

$$
\mathcal Z^{\pi^\ast}_{x,a} \overset{D}{=} R(x,a) + \gamma \mathcal Z^{\pi^\ast}_{X',A'}
$$

$$
V^\pi(x,a) := \mathbb E[\mathcal Z^{\pi^\ast}_{x,a}] = \mathbb E [R(x,a)] + \gamma \mathbb E_{P,\pi}[V^\pi(X',A')]
$$

which is exactly the **scalar Bellman expectation equation**.

**Consequence:** Distributional RL *strictly contains* classical RL: every classical solution arises as the mean of **one and only one** return distribution, while the reverse is not true.

### Control-Stage Challenges

For control, define:
$$(\mathcal{T}\mathcal{Z})_{x,a} = \text{Law}(R(x,a) + \gamma \mathcal{Z}_{X', a^*(X')})$$
where \(a^*(x') \in \arg\max_{a'} \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{Z}_{x',a'}]\).

**Theorem 2:** \(\mathcal{T}\) is *not* a contraction in any integral probability metric—even though its *mean* counterpart \(T\) *is* a \(\gamma\)-contraction.

This *instability* does not break the abstraction (the mean is still preserved), but it does mean that additional assumptions (e.g., unique optimal policy) or algorithmic tweaks are required for guaranteed convergence in the control setting.

## 4. Risk-Aware Objectives: Why They Become "Cheap"

### Beyond Expected Returns

In reinforcement learning we usually optimize the **expected return**:
$$J_{\text{exp}}(\pi) = \mathbb{E}[G^\pi], \quad G^\pi = \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^t R_t$$

which implicitly treats all variability in the random return \(G^\pi\) as irrelevant.

A **risk-aware (or risk-sensitive) objective** replaces the plain expectation by a *functional* \(\rho: \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}\) that scores **the entire return distribution \(\mathcal{G}^\pi\)**:
$$J_\rho(\pi) = \rho(\mathcal{G}^\pi)$$

Typical choices of \(\rho\) emphasize *tail events*, *dispersion*, or *asymmetry*:

| Risk Functional \(\rho\) | Formal Definition | Captures |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Variance-penalized mean** | \(\mathbb{E}[G] - \lambda \text{Var}[G]\) | Trade-off accuracy vs. volatility |
| **Value-at-Risk (VaR\(_\alpha\))** | \(\inf\{z: \Pr(G \leq z) \geq \alpha\}\) | Worst loss not exceeded with prob. \(1-\alpha\) |
| **Conditional VaR/CVaR\(_\alpha\)** | \(\mathbb{E}[G \mid G \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha]\) | Expected loss *inside* the tail |
| **Entropic risk** | \(-\frac{1}{\eta}\log \mathbb{E}[e^{-\eta G}]\) | Exponential utility, robust to model error |
| **Sharpe-like ratios** | \(\frac{\mathbb{E}[G]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[G]}}\) | Risk-adjusted performance |

All of these depend on higher-order statistics (variance, quantiles, cumulants) that the scalar \(V^\pi = \mathbb{E}[G]\) cannot supply.

### The Economics of Risk-Aware Objectives

| Stage | Classical RL (mean only) | Distributional RL |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Learning** | Train a value-function approximator for \(V^\pi\) | Train a model \(\hat{\mathcal{G}}^\pi\) (categorical, quantile, mixture, ...) that outputs the *full* return distribution |
| **Switch to a new risk metric** | **Re-learn** or fine-tune because \(V^\pi\) lacks tails; must approximate \(\rho\) indirectly by shaping rewards or redefining TD targets | **No retraining:** compute \(\rho(\hat{\mathcal{G}}^\pi)\) by closed-form formula or a small Monte-Carlo sample from the stored distribution |
| **Per-state cost** | Extra simulation or network forward passes; sometimes impossible (e.g. CVaR needs quantiles you never estimated) | \(O(K)\) arithmetic where \(K\) = number of atoms/quantiles (usually 50-200) |
| **Policy improvement** | Need brand-new loss/objective; may destabilize training | Plug \(\rho(\hat{\mathcal{G}}^\pi)\) into the \(\arg\max\) step; gradients flow through the same network |

**Key intuition:** Learning \(\hat{\mathcal{G}}^\pi\) is the "expensive" part (it subsumes learning the mean). *Any* coherent risk measure is then a *post-processing* of that distribution—just a few tensor operations on the output layer.

### Illustrative Examples of the "Cheapness"

| Domain | Distribution learned once | Cheap risk queries afterwards |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Autonomous drone** | Histogram of future altitude loss during maneuvers | • Probability of crash < 0 m?<br>• CVaR of worst 1% drop? |
| **Portfolio RL** | Quantile network for monthly P&L | • Sharpe ratio<br>• 99% VaR<br>• Prob. draw-down > 10% |
| **Game-playing (Atari)** | C51 distribution over cumulative score | • Expected score (for leaderboard)<br>• Variance (for curriculum difficulty) |

Each query is a *constant-time* reduction over the stored support/probability vectors.

### When It Isn't Cheap

1. **Representation too coarse.** If the support range is badly truncated or too few quantiles are used, tail estimates become noisy; risk measures lose fidelity.
2. **Epistemic uncertainty dominates.** A pointwise return distribution does not express *model uncertainty*; additional Bayesian layers are needed.
3. **High-dimensional action selection.** Computing \(\rho(\mathcal{G}^\pi(s,a))\) for thousands of continuous actions may still be costly; actor-critic architectures alleviate this with a separate policy network.

## 5. Workflow Applications

### How the Difference Manifests Across Workflows

| Workflow | Classical Recipe | Distributional Analogue | Added Value/New Issues |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Offline planning** (full model known; dynamic programming, policy iteration, value iteration) | Iterate **Bellman expectation operator** until convergence | **Distributional Dynamic Programming (DDP)** – iterate distributional Bellman operator, then compute risk-aware or expectation policies | Yields *entire* future-return law for each state, enabling post-hoc evaluation of multiple risk criteria without re-planning |
| **Online planning** (look-ahead search such as MCTS, Dyna, model-predictive control) | Roll-outs/back-ups use mean returns; bandit criteria balance exploration/exploitation on means | Roll-outs/back-ups propagate distributions (e.g., histogram MCTS, quantile tree-search); bandit logic can use stochastic-dominance or CVaR-UCB | More informative uncertainty estimates improve risk-aware decision making and better guide exploration in stochastic domains (e.g., games with heavy-tailed payoffs) |
| **Batch/fitted RL** (learn value function from a fixed dataset) | Fitted-Q iteration, LSPI, Neural FQI | Distributional FQI: fit a distribution model per state-action, then project distributional Bellman target (e.g., quantile regression loss) | Captures aleatoric variance present in logged data; downstream policy can optimize different risk profiles without re-training |
| **Incremental/TD learning** | TD(λ), Q-learning update a scalar | Categorical TD, Quantile TD (QR-DQN), Implicit Quantile Networks: update the whole distribution per step | Extra hyperparameters (support range, number of quantiles), sensitivity to projection bias and probability metric choice |

## 6. Practical Implementation Approaches

### Representation Methods

**Categorical (C51)**
- Discretize return support \([V_{\min}, V_{\max}]\) into \(N\) atoms: \(z_i = V_{\min} + i \cdot \frac{V_{\max} - V_{\min}}{N-1}\)
- Learn probability mass \(p_i\) for each atom: \(\mathcal{Z}(s,a) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} p_i(s,a) \delta_{z_i}\)
- **Loss:** Cross-entropy between projected target pmf and current pmf
- **Advantages:** Simple, interpretable, good empirical performance
- **Disadvantages:** Fixed support range, projection bias, sensitive to \(V_{\min}/V_{\max}\) choice

**Quantile Regression (QR-DQN)**
- Learn specific quantiles \(\tau_1, ..., \tau_N\) of return distribution
- **Loss:** Quantile (pinball) loss: \(\rho_\tau(u) = u(\tau - \mathbf{1}_{u<0})\)
- **Advantages:** Adaptive support, excellent tail estimation, theoretically principled
- **Disadvantages:** Requires choosing quantile levels, more complex than C51

**Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN)**
- Learn continuous quantile function \(F_Z^{-1}(\tau)\) for \(\tau \in [0,1]\)
- Sample quantiles \(\tau \sim \text{Uniform}[0,1]\) during training/evaluation
- **Advantages:** Maximum flexibility, no pre-specified quantiles, best empirical performance
- **Disadvantages:** Most complex, hardest to interpret, requires careful architecture design

### Error Metrics and Evaluation

**Classical RL Metrics:**
- Mean-Squared Error (MSE): \(\|\hat{V} - V^\pi\|_2^2\)
- Mean-Absolute Error (MAE): \(\|\hat{V} - V^\pi\|_1\)
- Root Mean Squared Value Error (RMSVE) over held-out state set

**Distributional RL Metrics:**

**Wasserstein Distance:**
$$W_p(\mu,\nu) = \left(\inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma(\mu,\nu)} \int |x-y|^p d\gamma(x,y)\right)^{1/p}$$

**Cramér Distance:**
$$\ell_2^2(\mu,\nu) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (F_\mu(z) - F_\nu(z))^2 dz$$

**Quantile Regression Loss:**
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K (\tau_i - \mathbf{1}_{u_i < 0}) u_i, \quad u_i = z^{\text{target}} - \hat{z}_\theta^{(i)}$$

**KL Divergence:** (for categorical representations)
$$D_{KL}(P||Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$$

### Algorithmic Details

**C51 Algorithm:**
1. **Forward pass:** Compute atom probabilities \(p_i(s,a)\) for current state-action
2. **Target computation:** For next state \(s'\), compute \(\mathcal T Z(s,a) = r + \gamma Z(s', \arg\max_{a'} \sum_i p_i(s',a') z_i)\)
3. **Projection:** Project target distribution onto fixed support using \(\Phi_z\) operator
4. **Loss:** Cross-entropy between projected target and current distribution
5. **Update:** Standard SGD on cross-entropy loss

**QR-DQN Algorithm:**
1. **Forward pass:** Compute quantiles \(\hat{z}_{\tau_i}(s,a)\) for fixed quantile levels \(\tau_i\)
2. **Target computation:** \(y_i = r + \gamma \hat z_{\tau_i}(s', \arg\max_{a'} \frac{1}{N} \sum_j \hat z_{\tau_j}(s',a'))\)
3. **Loss:** Quantile regression loss \(\rho_{\tau_i}(y_i - \hat{z}_{\tau_i}(s,a))\)
4. **Update:** SGD on quantile loss

**IQN Algorithm:**
1. **Forward pass:** Sample \(\tau \sim \text{Uniform}[0,1]\), compute \(\hat{z}_\tau(s,a)\)
2. **Target computation:** Similar to QR-DQN but with sampled quantiles
3. **Loss:** Quantile regression loss with sampled \(\tau\)
4. **Update:** SGD with respect to both quantile function and sampled quantiles

### Approximation Challenges

| Source of Approximation | Possible Leak | Known Mitigations |
|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Projection of targets** (e.g. C51 categorical projection) | Mean of projected distribution ≠ true mean ⇒ scalar Bellman equation no longer holds exactly | Use *mean-preserving* projections (Cramér, quantile regression) or add a correction term |
| **Finite support or too few quantiles** | Tail risk understated; risk functionals mis-estimated | Dynamic support expansion; heteroscedastic quantile spacing |
| **Control-stage instability** | Iterates may oscillate in Wasserstein metric although means converge | Perturbations such as *one-step distributional RL*, entropy regularization, or proving convergence under unique-optimal-policy assumption |

## 7. Evaluation Protocols and Benchmarks

### Standard Evaluation in Literature

| Setting | Classical Baseline | Distributional Counterpart |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Tabular policy evaluation** | Compute RMSVE against exact dynamic-programming \(V^\pi\) | Compute average \(W_1\) (or Cramér) between learned \(\hat{\mathcal{Z}}\) and analytic \(\mathcal{Z}^\pi\) (possible on small chains) |
| **Atari 2600 (Deep RL)** | Report mean human-normalized score of DQN variants | C51/QR-DQN report *same* score **plus** distributional diagnostics (average KL or \(W_1\) on held-out rollouts) |
| **Risk-aware control tasks** | Evaluate CVaR of total reward computed via Monte-Carlo | Measure CVaR directly from predicted distributions; also test pinball loss convergence |

### Micro-Example: Toy MDP

| Toy MDP | Classical Estimate | Distributional Estimate |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **One-step coin:** reward +5 w.p. 0.1, else -1 | \(V = 0.1 \times 5 + 0.9 \times (-1) = -0.4\) | \(\mathcal{Z} = \begin{cases} +5 & p=0.1 \\ -1 & p=0.9 \end{cases}\) |
| **Error if learner predicts 0** | Absolute value error = 0.4 | Wasserstein-1 error = \(0.1 \times |5-0| + 0.9 \times |-1-0| = 1.4\) |
| **Insight** | Scalar error small; agent believes near-neutral outcome | Probability metric reveals heavy left-tail (risk of -1) and right-tail (rare +5) |

## 8. Challenges and Limitations

### Computational Overhead
- **Memory:** Store 50-200 atoms/quantiles instead of single scalar
- **Computation:** More complex forward/backward passes, projection operations
- **Network size:** Distributional heads require \(K\) times more parameters
- **Training time:** Typically 1.5-3x slower than classical methods

### Representation Challenges
- **Support selection:** Choosing appropriate \([V_{\min}, V_{\max}]\) and number of atoms/quantiles
- **Projection bias:** Approximation errors when projecting onto finite supports
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** More tuning required than classical methods
- **Tail estimation:** Finite representations may poorly capture extreme events

### Theoretical Gaps
- **Control instability:** Distributional Bellman operator for control lacks contraction property
- **Convergence guarantees:** Weaker than classical RL in some settings
- **Sample complexity:** Not always clear when distributional methods improve data efficiency
- **Optimality:** Relationship between distributional and classical optimality not fully understood

### Practical Issues
- **Debugging complexity:** Harder to diagnose issues with distribution learning
- **Interpretability:** Less intuitive than scalar values for domain experts
- **Implementation complexity:** More intricate algorithms, careful numerical considerations
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Support range, number of quantiles, loss function choice

## 9. When to Use Each Approach

### Decision Framework

| Scenario | Classical RL Sufficient? | Distributional RL Recommended? |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Deterministic control or variance-irrelevant tasks | ✓ | – |
| Finance, energy markets, safety-critical robotics, games with high-variance payoffs | – | ✓ |
| Compute-constrained embedded systems | ✓ | – (unless catastrophic-risk critical) |
| Multi-objective or late-binding utility (utility chosen after learning) | – | ✓ (learn once, evaluate many objectives) |
| Sparse-reward exploration | – | ✓ (better exploration signals) |
| Well-understood domains with established benchmarks | ✓ | – |
| Research/analysis where understanding return structure matters | – | ✓ |

### Indicators for Risk-Sensitive Tasks

**Strong Indicators (use distributional RL):**
- Histogram of returns shows multiple modes, heavy skew, or fat tails
- Empirical variance or CVaR is large relative to mean
- Domain mentions "safety", "risk", "guarantees", "worst-case"
- Small policy changes affect failure probability while preserving mean
- Stakeholders have different risk tolerances

**Weak Indicators (consider classical RL first):**
- Approximately Gaussian return distributions
- Risk-neutral objectives sufficient
- Computational constraints dominate
- Deterministic or low-variance environments

## 10. Trade-offs and Practical Considerations

### Advantage-Cost Analysis

| Advantage of Distributional View | Corresponding Cost/Caveat |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Can design **safer** or **risk-seeking** agents; identify catastrophic-tail events | Requires choosing a **representation** and **probability metric**; poor choices harm convergence |
| Provides richer feedback for **exploration** (e.g., optimistic sampling on high quantiles) | **Bootstrapping instability** stronger; must align projection with SGD-friendly losses |
| Post-hoc policy evaluation over many utility functions | Higher memory/compute (store tens-to-hundreds of atoms or quantiles instead of one scalar) |
| Potentially faster learning when the *shape* of reward distribution conveys signal (multi-modal tasks) | Benefits diminish if environment is almost deterministic; gains depend on quality of distribution estimate |

### Getting Started: Practical Guidelines

**Phase 1: Assessment**
1. **Analyze your reward distribution:** Plot histograms of episode returns
2. **Identify risk sensitivity:** Look for safety constraints, tail events, multi-modal outcomes
3. **Evaluate computational budget:** Distributional methods require 2-5x more compute
4. **Consider stakeholder needs:** Multiple risk preferences favor distributional approach

**Phase 2: Implementation**
1. **Start simple:** Begin with C51 for categorical distributions
2. **Tune support carefully:** Use domain knowledge to set \([V_{\min}, V_{\max}]\)
3. **Monitor multiple metrics:** Track mean, variance, and tail statistics simultaneously
4. **Compare with classical baseline:** Ensure distributional method actually helps

**Phase 3: Advanced Techniques**
1. **Upgrade representation:** Move to quantile methods for better tail estimation
2. **Optimize hyperparameters:** Careful tuning of support range, number of atoms
3. **Implement risk-aware policies:** Use learned distributions for CVaR optimization
4. **Evaluate multiple objectives:** Demonstrate value of "learn once, evaluate many"

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Pitfall 1: Inadequate Support Range**
- **Problem:** Returns fall outside \([V_{\min}, V_{\max}]\)
- **Solution:** Use percentile-based support estimation, dynamic expansion

**Pitfall 2: Too Few Atoms/Quantiles**
- **Problem:** Poor approximation of distribution tails
- **Solution:** Increase \(N\) gradually, use non-uniform quantile spacing

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring Projection Bias**
- **Problem:** Mean of projected distribution differs from true mean
- **Solution:** Use mean-preserving projections, monitor scalar Bellman error

**Pitfall 4: Overengineering**
- **Problem:** Using distributional methods when classical RL suffices
- **Solution:** Start with classical baseline, upgrade only when benefits are clear
