This section summarizes key results and concepts related to Value Iteration and Policy Iteration in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a focus on their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications.
A. Sensitivity of Greedy Policies (Continuity/Sensitivity Result)
Core Idea: A greedy policy derived from an approximate value function \(V\) will yield a policy whose true value function \(V_\pi\) is "close" to the optimal value function \(V^\), provided \(V\) itself is close to \(V^\).
Mathematical Expression: The value function of the greedy policy, \(V_\pi\), is bounded in its distance from \(V^\) by a factor related to the maximum difference between the chosen \(V\) and \(V^\). Specifically, the maximum distance is scaled by \(2\gamma / (1-\gamma)\), where \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
Geometric Interpretation: If \(V\) is a point in the high-dimensional value function space, and \(V^\) is the optimal value function, then the value function \(V_\pi\) obtained by greedifying \(V\) will lie within a "box" or "square" region around \(V^\), whose size is proportional to the distance between \(V\) and \(V^\). As \(V\) approaches \(V^\), \(V_\pi\) also approaches \(V^*\).
Significance: This result is crucial for understanding the robustness of greedy policies to errors in value function estimation. It ensures that even if we don't have the perfectly optimal value function, a greedy policy derived from a reasonably good approximation will still perform near-optimally.
B. Value Function Space Properties
Convexity: The set of all valid value functions for all possible policies in an MDP forms a convex set. While not formally proven in the lecture, this property is mentioned as a known result.
Corners of the Minimum Enclosing Rectangle: For this convex set, the upper-right corner of its minimum enclosing rectangle corresponds to \(V^*\) (the maximum possible value for each state independently). The lower-left corner would correspond to the minimum possible values (if considering costs, or if minimizing rewards). Both of these extreme points belong to the set of valid value functions.
Extreme Points: The extreme points (or "corners") of the value function polytope correspond to value functions of deterministic, memoryless policies.
C. Value Iteration (VI)
Algorithm: Value iteration is an iterative method for approximating \(V^*\). It starts with an initial value function (e.g., all zeros) and repeatedly applies the Bellman optimality operator \(T\).
\(V_{k+1} = T(V_k)\), where \(T(V)(s) = \max_a [R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)V(s')]\).
Convergence: Value iteration converges to \(V^\) geometrically fast. The distance (in infinity norm) between \(V_k\) and \(V^\) decreases by a factor of \(\gamma\) at each iteration.
\(||V_{k+1} - V^||_\infty \le \gamma ||V_k - V^||_\infty\).
Iteration Complexity: The number of iterations \(k\) required to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation of \(V^\) (i.e., \(||V_k - V^||_\infty \le \epsilon\)) is approximately \(O(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})\). More precisely, \(k \ge \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(\frac{\epsilon (1-\gamma)}{||V_0 - V^*||_\infty})\).
Relevance: Value iteration's convergence properties, combined with the sensitivity result, provide a concrete method to find a near-optimal policy by first approximating \(V^*\).
D. Policy Iteration (PI)
Algorithm: Policy iteration alternates between two steps:
Policy Evaluation: For the current policy \(\pi_k\), compute its true value function \(V_{\pi_k}\). This involves solving a system of linear equations.
Policy Improvement: Derive a new greedy policy \(\pi_{k+1}\) with respect to \(V_{\pi_k}\).
Convergence: Policy iteration is guaranteed to find an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations, specifically at most \(S \cdot A\) iterations (where S is the number of states and A is the number of actions), assuming ties are resolved systematically. This is because the sequence of policies generated is monotonically improving, and there are a finite number of distinct deterministic policies.
Comparison with Value Iteration:Accuracy: PI finds the exact optimal policy (or its value function), while VI provides an approximation that gets arbitrarily close.
Complexity: PI iterations are more expensive (solving linear equations), but it generally converges in fewer iterations than VI for achieving exact optimality. For obtaining a near-optimal policy (low accuracy), VI might be faster due to cheaper per-iteration cost.
Runtime: The overall runtime for PI to find an optimal policy is often quoted as \(O(S^4 A^2 / (1-\gamma))\), but a more precise analysis considering the cost of policy evaluation yields \(O(S^2 A \cdot S)\) or similar if policy evaluation is performed efficiently. The lecture mentions a comparison that shows PI's runtime might be \(O(S^4 A^2 H)\), where \(H\) is the effective horizon, which can be seen as \(1/(1-\gamma)\).
E. Computational Complexity
Arithmetic/Logic Operations Model: The discussion primarily uses a model where basic arithmetic and logic operations (addition, multiplication, maximization) each count as one "step," regardless of the size of the numbers involved.
Binary Computation Model (Turing Machine): An alternative is the Turing machine model, where the size of numbers (number of bits) and the time to read input tables matter. This model is generally more precise but also more complex.
Worst-Case Lower Bounds: The theoretical lower bounds for finding an optimal policy often involve a dependence on \(S\) (number of states) and \(A\) (number of actions), suggesting that every state-action pair must be "touched" at least once. The \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor often appears as a characteristic time or "effective horizon."
Vanishing Discount Approach (Gamma goes to 1): Taking \(\gamma \to 1\) relates to the average reward setting. In this context, the value functions are often normalized by multiplying with \((1-\gamma)\) to converge to the average reward. The "span" of value functions plays a role in bounding the complexity in the average reward setting.
F. Value Difference Identity/Decomposition
Purpose: This is a fundamental identity that relates the value functions of two different policies or an approximate value function to the optimal one.
Utility: It is widely used in proofs and derivations in reinforcement learning, including analyses of convergence and bounds. It often allows for direct comparison and decomposition of value differences.

Quiz Answer Key
The continuity/sensitivity result states that if you take any value function \(V\) and derive a greedy policy from it, the value function of that policy, \(V_\pi\), will be close to the optimal value function \(V^\) if \(V\) itself was close to \(V^\). This means small errors in value function approximation lead to small errors in the value of the resulting policy.
The space of all valid value functions forms a convex set. Additionally, the upper-right corner of the minimum enclosing rectangle of this set corresponds to the optimal value function \(V^*\), and it belongs to the set.
Value Iteration converges to the optimal value function \(V^\) by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\). Its geometric convergence rate means that the error (distance to \(V^\)) is reduced by a constant factor (\(\gamma\), the discount factor) at each iteration.
Value Iteration iteratively refines the value function until it approximates the optimal value function, from which a policy can be extracted. Policy Iteration, on the other hand, alternates between evaluating a policy and then greedily improving it, directly converging to an optimal policy in a finite number of steps.
Value Iteration might be preferred for low-accuracy approximations because its per-iteration cost is lower. Policy Iteration, despite its higher per-iteration cost (due to policy evaluation), is preferred for finding the exact optimal policy, as it's guaranteed to converge in a finite number of iterations.
Geometric convergence, in the context of Value Iteration, means that the difference between the current value function approximation \(V_k\) and the true optimal value function \(V^*\) shrinks by a constant multiplicative factor (the discount factor \(\gamma\)) with each successive iteration. This implies exponentially fast reduction in error.
The vanishing discount approach considers the behavior of value functions as the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1. This limit often relates to the average reward setting, where value functions are normalized by \((1-\gamma)\) to represent the long-term average reward rather than a discounted sum.
The effective horizon, \(H \approx 1/(1-\gamma)\), represents the characteristic time scale for rewards to significantly impact the total discounted return. In Value Iteration, this factor determines the number of iterations required for convergence, indicating that problems with \(\gamma\) very close to 1 require many more steps.
The Value Difference Decomposition is a fundamental identity that literally breaks down the difference between value functions into components, often relating to immediate rewards and future discounted values under different policies. It is crucial because it forms the basis for many proofs and analyses in reinforcement learning, including convergence guarantees and bounds.
The two computational models discussed are the arithmetic and logic operations model (where basic operations count as one unit) and the binary computation model (like a Turing machine, where bit-level operations and input size matter). The lecture primarily uses the simpler arithmetic and logic operations model.

Optimal Value Function (V):* The maximum possible expected cumulative reward achievable from each state, corresponding to the optimal policy.
Policy (π): A rule that dictates the action to be taken in each state. A deterministic policy maps states to actions; a stochastic policy maps states to a probability distribution over actions.

What is the core concept behind the first result discussed in the lecture, regarding the relationship between an arbitrary value function and the optimal value function?
The first result establishes a "continuity" or "sensitivity" relationship between an arbitrary value function, V, and the optimal value function, V*. It states that if you take any function V (which maps states to rewards) and then derive a greedy policy (π) based on this V (meaning you choose the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead values according to V), the value function of this resulting policy (Vπ) will be "almost optimal." Geometrically, if you consider the space of value functions (Rs), the optimal value function V* occupies the "upper right corner" of the minimum enclosing rectangle of the convex set of all valid value functions. The theorem demonstrates that Vπ will be close to V* proportionally to how close V was to V*. Specifically, the "distance" (infinity norm) between Vπ and V* is bounded by a factor of 2γ / (1 - γ) times the distance between V and V*. This means if V is very close to V*, then the policy derived from it will also yield a value function very close to the optimal.
How does the space of value functions look, and what are its key properties?
The space of value functions is represented as R^S, where S is the number of states. All valid value functions for all possible policies are points within this high-dimensional space. A key property is that this set of value functions is convex. This means that if you take any two valid value functions, any point on the line segment connecting them is also a valid value function. Furthermore, the "corners" of the minimum enclosing rectangle of this set (specifically the upper-right and lower-left corners) belong to the set itself. The upper-right corner corresponds to V*, the optimal value function (obtained by maximizing rewards), while the lower-left corner would correspond to minimizing rewards.
Explain the concept of Value Iteration (VI) and its convergence properties.
Value Iteration is a simple iterative algorithm used to approximate the optimal value function (V*). It starts with an initial value function (e.g., all zeros) and repeatedly applies the Bellman optimality operator (T). Each application of T moves the current value function closer to V*. The key convergence property of Value Iteration is that the distance (in infinity norm) between the current iterated value function (Vk) and the optimal value function (V*) decreases by a factor of gamma (γ) with each iteration. This is due to the contraction property of the Bellman operator. This geometric convergence means that to reach an ε-optimal approximation of V* (i.e., within ε distance), the number of iterations required is proportional to log(1/ε) / log(1/γ) or approximately (1 / (1 - γ)) * log(1/ε).
How does the complexity of Value Iteration relate to finding an ε-optimal policy?
The previous result about Value Iteration's convergence can be combined with the first theorem (the continuity result) to determine the overall computational complexity of finding an ε-optimal policy using Value Iteration. If Value Iteration computes a value function V_k that is ε-close to V*, then the greedy policy derived from V_k will result in a value function V_π that is approximately (2γ / (1 - γ)) * ε away from V*. Therefore, to ensure that the policy's value is within a desired sub-optimality level (let's say δ), you need to choose ε small enough such that (2γ / (1 - γ)) * ε ≤ δ. Plugging this ε back into the iteration complexity for Value Iteration, the total number of operations required is roughly proportional to S^2 * A / (1 - γ) * log(1/δ), where S is the number of states and A is the number of actions.
What is Policy Iteration (PI), and how does its complexity compare to Value Iteration?
Policy Iteration is another algorithm for finding an optimal policy. It involves two main steps:
Policy Evaluation: For a given policy, calculate its exact value function.
Policy Improvement (Greedification): Derive a new policy by choosing the greedy action with respect to the current value function. This process is repeated. Policy Iteration is guaranteed to find an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations. The maximum number of iterations for Policy Iteration is bounded by S * A * (S + A) if ties in the greedy action selection are resolved systematically. Unlike Value Iteration, Policy Iteration guarantees finding an optimal policy (not just ε-optimal) after a finite number of steps, meaning the log(1/δ) term for precision is absent. When comparing complexities, for very high accuracy requirements (δ very small), Policy Iteration tends to be faster because its complexity does not blow up with increasing precision, whereas Value Iteration's does. However, for lower accuracy requirements, Value Iteration can be cheaper per iteration and thus potentially faster.
Why is the 1 / (1 - γ) factor significant in the context of convergence and "horizon"?
The 1 / (1 - γ) factor, often referred to as the "effective horizon," represents a characteristic timescale or "memory" of the system in discounted infinite-horizon MDPs. When gamma (γ) is close to 1, this factor becomes very large, implying that future rewards are discounted very little. This means the system considers a very long horizon of future events, making it harder and slower to converge to the optimal solution. The geometric convergence rates for algorithms like Value Iteration depend directly on γ, and as γ approaches 1, the convergence becomes slower because more iterations are needed to account for these very long-term interactions. This factor is also relevant when connecting discounted MDPs to the average reward setting, as taking the limit of γ approaching 1 (after normalization) can model average reward problems.
What is the "value difference decomposition" or "identity," and why is it important?
The "value difference decomposition" or "identity" is a fundamental mathematical relationship derived directly from the definitions of value functions. It allows for expressing the difference between two value functions (e.g., Vπ and Vπ') in terms of the differences in action choices and expected future rewards. This identity is extremely useful because it forms the basis for proving convergence properties, deriving bounds, and designing various algorithms in reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. It provides a way to quantify how changes in policy or value estimates propagate through the system, making it a cornerstone for theoretical analysis.
What are the considerations regarding computational models when analyzing algorithm complexity in MDPs?
When analyzing the computational complexity of MDP algorithms, the choice of computational model is crucial. The lecture primarily uses an "arithmetic/logic operations" model, where basic operations like addition, multiplication, and maximization each count as one "step." This is a common simplification but differs from a "binary computation model" (like a Turing machine model), where complexity is measured by the number of bit operations. In the binary model, the size of input numbers (e.g., probabilities) matters, as larger numbers require more bits and thus more operations for basic arithmetic. The choice of model can affect the perceived efficiency of algorithms, especially when dealing with potentially very small or very large numerical values, or when the representation of input (e.g., how probability tables are stored) influences computational cost.

The policy error bound theorem, also referred to as a continuity or sensitivity result, describes how close the value function of a greedy policy is to the optimal value function, based on an initial approximation.

Here are the full details to understand the theorem:

*   **Premise and Conditions**:
    *   The theorem applies to a **finite state-action discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP)**.
    *   You start with **any arbitrary function `v`** that maps states to real numbers (i.e., `v` is a point in the `R^S` space of value functions, where `S` is the number of states). This `v` does not necessarily have to be a valid value function for any specific policy.
    *   A **greedy policy (`pi`) is then chosen with respect to `v`**. This means that for each state, the policy selects the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead values calculated using `v`.
        *   The greedy choice maximizes `(reward + gamma * sum(P(next_state | current_state, action) * v(next_state)))` over all possible actions.

*   **The Policy Error Bound**:
    The theorem states that the value function of the greedy policy (`v_pi`) will be **"almost optimal"**. The degree of its optimality is directly related to how much the initial function `v` differs from the true optimal value function (`v_star`).

    Mathematically, the bound is expressed as:
    **`||v_pi - v_star||_infinity <= (2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)) * ||v - v_star||_infinity`**

    Let's break down the components:
    *   **`v_pi`**: The value function of the policy (`pi`) that was derived by being greedy with respect to `v`.
    *   **`v_star`**: The optimal value function. It represents the maximum possible value achievable from each state. It is also characterized as the upper-right corner of the minimum enclosing rectangle of the value function space.
    *   **`|| . ||_infinity`**: This denotes the **infinity norm (or maximum norm)**. It measures the maximum absolute difference between the values of the two functions across all states. So, `||f - g||_infinity = max_s |f(s) - g(s)|`. The use of this norm is beneficial because various operations within the Bellman operator (like maximization, linear operations, and addition of rewards) are non-expansions or contractions under this norm.
    *   **`gamma`**: This is the discount factor, a value between 0 and 1, that determines the present value of future rewards.
    *   **`(2 * gamma / (1 - gamma))`**: This is the **"blow up factor"**. It signifies that the error in the policy's value function (`v_pi`) is bounded by the error in the initial approximation (`v`), multiplied by this factor. This factor is indeed "real" and can be exhibited in examples. The term `1/(1-gamma)` is often referred to as the **effective horizon (H)**.

*   **Geometric Interpretation**:
    *   The space of all possible value functions (`R^S`) has an interesting structure. The set of value functions for all possible policies forms a **convex set**.
    *   The optimal value function, `v_star`, is a point within this convex set, specifically the upper-right corner of its minimum enclosing rectangle.
    *   The theorem can be visualized as follows: If you choose an arbitrary function `v` (a point in the `R^S` space), and then derive a greedy policy from it, the value function of that greedy policy (`v_pi`) will lie within a **"box" or "set" centered around `v_star`**. The size of this box is determined by the maximum distance between `v` and `v_star`, inflated by the `2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)` factor.
    *   This means that `v_pi` is guaranteed to be close to `v_star` if `v` is close to `v_star`, indicating that `v_pi` lives in a subset of the value function polytope that is near `v_star`.

*   **Significance and Implications**:
    *   **Continuity Result**: The theorem demonstrates a continuous relationship: **if `||v - v_star||_infinity` approaches zero (i.e., `v` gets closer to `v_star`), then `v_pi` also converges to `v_star`**. This is why it's considered a continuity or sensitivity result.
    *   **Sufficiency for Near-Optimality**: It is a fundamental result that shows **approximating the optimal value function (`v`) well is sufficient to obtain a near-optimal policy** (`v_pi`). This is crucial because directly finding the optimal policy can be challenging, but finding a good approximation of the optimal value function might be more feasible.
    *   **Foundation for Complexity Analysis**: This policy error bound, particularly when combined with the convergence properties of value iteration, allows for the analysis of the computational complexity required to achieve an "epsilon-optimal" policy. If the error `epsilon` is made small enough, the loss due to not knowing the truly optimal policy will be limited by this bound.
    *   **Frequent Use**: This result, or variations of it, is used "all the time" in reinforcement learning theory, especially when evaluating how well an algorithm approximates the optimal value function and how that translates to policy performance.

The high-dimensional space of value functions is a crucial concept for understanding Reinforcement Learning theory, particularly in the context of the policy error bound theorem and value iteration.

Here are the details about what this space is like:

*   **Nature of the Space**:
    *   It is represented as **\(R^S\)**, where 'S' is the number of states in the finite state-action discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). Each point in this space corresponds to a function `v` that maps states to real numbers.

*   **Structure of Value Functions within this Space**:
    *   The set of **all possible value functions for all possible policies forms a convex set** within \(R^S\). This means that if you take any two valid value functions for policies and draw a line between them, every point on that line also represents a valid value function for some policy.
    *   This set has a "funny structure".
    *   The **optimal value function, `v_star`**, is a specific point within this convex set. It is characterized as the **upper-right corner of the minimum enclosing rectangle** of the value function set. This means `v_star` represents the highest achievable value from each state.
    *   Similarly, the value function resulting from minimizing rewards (or maximizing costs) would correspond to the lower-left corner of this minimum enclosing rectangle, and this point also belongs to the set of valid value functions.
    *   All points within this specific convex polytope are considered "valid value functions" for some policy.
    *   The **corners or extreme points of this convex set correspond to deterministic memoryless policies**.
    *   Even if some states are completely disconnected from others (e.g., trap states), the value function space still holds this convex structure. If the MDP has disconnected components, the set will have a product structure, but a product of convex sets remains convex.

*   **Relationship to the Policy Error Bound Theorem**:
    *   The theorem starts by taking **any arbitrary function `v`**, which is just a point in this \(R^S\) space. This `v` does not necessarily have to be a valid value function of any specific policy.
    *   A **greedy policy (`pi`) is then chosen with respect to this `v`**. This greedy policy's value function, `v_pi`, is then guaranteed to be "almost optimal".
    *   **Geometrically, the theorem states that `v_pi` will live within a specific "box" or "set" around `v_star`**. This "box" is defined such that its size is determined by the **maximum absolute difference (`||v - v_star||_infinity`)** between your initial guess `v` and the true `v_star`, inflated by a "blow up factor" of **`(2 * gamma / (1 - gamma))`**.
    *   Since `v_pi` also has to be a valid value function, it must reside within both this calculated "box" and the convex polytope of value functions.
    *   This relationship highlights a **continuity (or sensitivity) result**: as the distance `||v - v_star||_infinity` approaches zero (meaning `v` gets closer to `v_star`), `v_pi` also converges to `v_star`. This implies that if you have a good approximation of the optimal value function, you will obtain a near-optimal policy.

*   **Role of the Infinity Norm**:
    *   The **infinity norm (`||.||_infinity`)**, which measures the maximum absolute difference between function values across all states, is used because it "happens to work". The various operations involved in the Bellman operator (T operator), such as maximization, linear operations (like `P` in `gamma * P * v`), and addition of rewards, are **non-expansions or contractions** under this specific norm. This property is crucial for proving the contraction mapping theorem and, consequently, the convergence of value iteration and the bounds in this policy error theorem.

*   **Value Iteration and the Space**:
    *   Value iteration is described as iteratively applying the Bellman optimality operator `T` to a function `v`. When visualized in this high-dimensional space, it means starting at an initial point (e.g., the zero point) and then moving along a "vector field" towards `v_star`. `v_star` is the **sole attractive fixed point** in this space. The convergence of value iteration towards `v_star` is geometrically fast, meaning errors are reduced by a constant factor of `gamma` at each step.


The sources indicate that the space of value functions is **convex**. While its convexity is not proven within the lecture material itself, it is stated that it **happens to be convex**.

Regarding the paper that proved this, the source states that there was a "nice paper just last year or two years ago" that demonstrated this. The paper's authors mentioned were **"dabashi and dale" and "some other folks"**.



Value iteration is a **fundamental algorithm for finding the optimal value function in a finite state-action discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. It operates by iteratively refining an approximation of the value function until it converges to the true optimal value function, `v_star`.

Here are the full details to understand value iteration:

*   **What Value Iteration Is**
    *   Value iteration is a **super simple way of calculating a sequence of value functions, `v_k`**.
    *   You typically **start with `v_0` as the zero function** (all states having a value of zero), though you can begin with any other point in the value function space.
    *   The core of value iteration is the **iterative application of the Bellman optimality operator `T`** to the current value function approximation. This operator is defined as: `T(v) = max_a (R(s, a) + gamma * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * v(s'))`.
        *   `R(s, a)` is the immediate reward for taking action `a` in state `s`.
        *   `gamma` is the discount factor.
        *   `P(s'|s,a)` is the transition probability from state `s` to state `s'` when taking action `a`.
        *   The `max_a` indicates that the operator selects the maximum one-step look-ahead value over all possible actions for each state.

*   **The High-Dimensional Value Function Space and Value Iteration**
    *   The space of all possible value functions is represented as **\(R^S\)**, where 'S' is the number of states.
    *   The set of all valid value functions for all possible policies forms a **convex set** within this \(R^S\) space.
    *   The **optimal value function, `v_star`, is the sole attractive fixed point** in this space. It also corresponds to the upper-right corner of the minimum enclosing rectangle of the value function set.
    *   When visualizing value iteration in this space, you **start at an initial point** (e.g., the zero point) and then **move along a "vector field" towards `v_star`**.
    *   **No matter where you start in the space, you will geometrically fast approach `v_star`**. The vector field can look in many different ways (e.g., swirling), but progress towards `v_star` is guaranteed without slowing down or getting stuck in "flat barriers".

*   **Convergence Properties**
    *   Value iteration converges to `v_star` because the **Bellman optimality operator `T` is a contraction mapping** under the infinity norm.
    *   The **infinity norm (`||.||_infinity`)** measures the maximum absolute difference between function values across all states. It "happens to work" because all operations involved in the `T` operator (maximization, linear operations, reward addition) are non-expansions or contractions under this norm.
    *   This contraction property means that the **distance between consecutive iterations and `v_star` decreases by a factor of `gamma`**: `||v_{k+1} - v_star||_infinity <= gamma * ||v_k - v_star||_infinity`. This is known as **geometric convergence**, meaning errors are reduced by a constant factor (`gamma`) at each step.
    *   Since `gamma` is between 0 and 1, `gamma` to the power of `k` will approach zero as `k` increases, ensuring convergence.

*   **Computational Complexity for Epsilon-Optimality**
    *   Value iteration allows you to **calculate a function `v_k` such that it is within an epsilon distance to `v_star`** in the maximum norm.
    *   The number of iterations `k` required to achieve this \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation is given by: **`k >= log(1/epsilon) / log(1/gamma)`** (or a slightly different form, `log(1/epsilon) * 1/(1-gamma)` which is an upper bound on `log(1/epsilon)/log(1/gamma)`).
    *   This `1/(1-gamma)` factor is often called the **"effective horizon" (H)** or a "characteristic time". It indicates that calculations can take longer if `gamma` is very close to 1. This "blow up factor" is **real** and can be demonstrated with examples.
    *   **Achieving an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation to the optimal value function is a reasonable goal because of the policy error bound theorem**. If `v_k` is sufficiently close to `v_star`, then the greedy policy derived from `v_k` will be near-optimal. The policy error bound states: `||v_pi - v_star||_infinity <= (2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)) * ||v - v_star||_infinity`. This means that if `||v - v_star||_infinity` (your error from value iteration) is small, the error in the derived policy's value function (`v_pi`) will also be bounded, scaled by the "blow-up factor" `2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)`.
    *   Combining these results provides an estimate of the **computational complexity to obtain a near-optimal policy using value iteration**: this would be approximately \(S^2A / (1-\gamma) * \log(1/\delta)\), where \(S\) is the number of states, \(A\) is the number of actions, and \(\delta\) is the desired precision.
    *   When comparing value iteration to policy iteration, value iteration is generally "cheap" in terms of per-iteration cost. For **low accuracy requirements, value iteration can win** over policy iteration because its dependence on accuracy (`log(1/delta)`) is logarithmic, whereas policy iteration's accuracy dependence is effectively unbounded (as it finds the optimal policy, requiring full precision). However, for very high accuracy, policy iteration eventually converges to the truly optimal policy in a finite number of iterations, making it preferable in that regime.

*   **General Complexity Considerations**
    *   The discussed complexities count **arithmetic and logic operations** (e.g., max, add, multiply each count as one).
    *   There's an ongoing discussion about whether these bounds are truly lower bounds and if better algorithms could exist. It's acknowledged that these are complex questions, similar to the open problems in matrix multiplication complexity.
    *   For instances where `gamma` is very close to 1, this effectively models the average reward setting (vanishing discount approach). In such cases, the `1/(1-gamma)` factor can be very large, indicating long horizons. While the `1/(1-gamma)` factor is considered real in the worst-case scenario, additional structure in specific MDPs (like termination probabilities) might allow for faster calculations.


Yes, the paper you've mentioned, **"The Value Function Polytope in Reinforcement Learning"**, directly corresponds to the "nice paper" referenced in the sources that proves the **convexity of the high-dimensional space of value functions**.

Here's how the paper relates to our discussion:

*   **Proof of Convexity**: The sources state that the set of all possible value functions for all possible policies forms a **convex set** within the \(R^S\) space (where \(S\) is the number of states). While this was noted as a known property and "happens to be true," it was also mentioned that it "was not part of the lectures" to prove it. Instead, it was proven in a "nice paper just last year or two years ago".
*   **Authorship**: The authors mentioned in connection to this proof were **"dabashi and dale" and "some other folks"**. The paper you cited aligns with these authors and the subject matter, indicating it is indeed the work being referred to.
*   **Structure of the Space**: This convexity is a key aspect of the "funny structure" of the value function space. The sources emphasize that this space is not just any convex set but has specific properties:
    *   The **optimal value function, `v_star`**, is located at the **upper-right corner of the minimum enclosing rectangle** of this high-dimensional convex set.
    *   Similarly, the value function resulting from minimizing rewards (or maximizing costs) would correspond to the lower-left corner, and this point also belongs to the set of valid value functions.
    *   The **corners or extreme points of this convex set correspond to deterministic memoryless policies**.
    *   The convexity holds even if states are disconnected or if there are trap states; in such cases, the set will have a product structure, but a product of convex sets remains convex.
*   **Significance**: Knowing that the value function space is convex is crucial for understanding the geometric interpretation of concepts like the policy error bound theorem and value iteration. For instance, value iteration involves iteratively moving towards `v_star`, which is the **sole attractive fixed point** in this convex space.

In essence, the paper you've identified provides the formal mathematical backing for the asserted convexity of the value function space, a property that is fundamental to the theoretical understanding of Reinforcement Learning algorithms discussed.


Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the **full, step-by-step mathematical proof of the policy error bound theorem is not explicitly detailed or derived within the given material**.

However, the sources do provide crucial insights into the theorem, its properties, its underlying mathematical principles, and what is considered "the key" to its derivation:

1.  **Statement of the Theorem:** The policy error bound theorem states that if you have an approximate value function `v` (which could be derived from value iteration, for example), and you then derive a greedy policy `pi` with respect to this `v`, the value function of that greedy policy (`v_pi`) will be "almost optimal" to the degree that `v` differs from the true optimal value function (`v_star`).
    *   The formula is presented as: **`||v_pi - v_star||_infinity <= (2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)) * ||v - v_star||_infinity`**.
    *   It is noted that there was a slight discrepancy in a lecture video regarding the factor of `2`, but the lecture notes confirm its presence.

2.  **Underlying Principles and "The Key":**
    *   The theorem's proof relies on **"contraction properties of the operators involved"**. The Bellman optimality operator `T` is a contraction mapping under the infinity norm, which is fundamental to the convergence of value iteration. The sources explain that the infinity norm "happens to work" because all operations within the `T` operator (maximization, linear operations, reward addition) are non-expansions or contractions under this norm.
    *   **The "key" to this result, and many others in the course, is the "value difference decomposition or identity"**. The sources state that this identity can be derived by "take[ing] the definitions literally of the value functions and then with two lines of octave you arrive at this identity". While the identity itself is not shown, its importance as a building block for the proof is heavily emphasized. This decomposition is described as "very useful" and "the basis for many different things".

3.  **Interpretation and Significance:**
    *   The theorem acts as a **"continuity result"** or "sensitivity result". It implies that if the distance between your approximate value function `v` and `v_star` goes to zero, then the value function of the greedy policy derived from `v` (`v_pi`) will also converge to `v_star`.
    *   The term **`2 * gamma / (1 - gamma)` is often referred to as a "blow up factor"**. This factor can be quite large, especially when `gamma` is very close to 1, indicating a long "effective horizon". This "blow up factor is real" and can be demonstrated with examples.
    *   A key implication for algorithms like value iteration is that **calculating an epsilon-optimal approximation to the optimal value function is a reasonable goal *because of this policy error bound***. If `v_k` is sufficiently close to `v_star`, the greedy policy derived from `v_k` will be near-optimal, with its suboptimality bounded by this theorem. This allows for an understanding of the computational complexity needed to obtain a near-optimal policy.

In summary, while the sources state the policy error bound theorem and explain its importance and the mathematical tools it employs (contraction properties, value difference decomposition), a direct, line-by-line proof is not provided. It is implied that the derivation from these fundamental components is straightforward ("two lines of octave" for the decomposition).



While the sources do not provide a full, line-by-line mathematical derivation of the **Value Iteration Theorem**, they offer substantial detail regarding the **core mathematical principles and properties** that underpin its proof and guarantee its convergence.

The "Value Iteration Theorem" essentially states that repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator `T` to any arbitrary initial value function `v_0` will generate a sequence of value functions `v_k` that **geometrically converges to the unique optimal value function `v_star`**. This convergence property also allows for the derivation of the algorithm's iteration complexity.

Here are the details from the sources that explain why Value Iteration converges:

*   **The Bellman Optimality Operator (T) is a Contraction Mapping**:
    *   This is the **fundamental reason** why Value Iteration converges. The sources explain that the `T` operator possesses "contraction properties" which ensure that the distance between consecutive iterations in the value function space decreases.
    *   Specifically, the `T` operator is a **contraction under the infinity norm (`||.||_infinity`)**. The infinity norm "happens to work" for this purpose.
    *   The contraction property means that for any two value functions `v_1` and `v_2`, applying the `T` operator will reduce the distance between them by a factor of `gamma` (the discount factor):
        **`||T(v_1) - T(v_2)||_infinity <= gamma * ||v_1 - v_2||_infinity`** (this is the general contraction property, which then applies to `v_k` and `v_star`).
    *   Since `v_star` is a fixed point of `T` (i.e., `T(v_star) = v_star`), applying the contraction property using `v_star` and `v_k` yields the key convergence step:
        **`||T(v_k) - T(v_star)||_infinity = ||v_{k+1} - v_star||_infinity <= gamma * ||v_k - v_star||_infinity`**.
        This shows that the distance from `v_star` is reduced by `gamma` at each step, implying **geometric convergence**.

*   **Components of the `T` Operator and their Behavior under Infinity Norm**:
    The Bellman optimality operator `T` for a value function `v` is described as: **`T(v) = M(R + gamma * P * v)`** where `M` denotes maximization over actions, `R` is the reward function, `P` is the transition probability matrix, and `gamma` is the discount factor. The reason the infinity norm is suitable is that all these constituent operations are either non-expansions or contractions under it:
    *   **`P * v` (Linear Operator for Transitions)**: The transition probability matrix `P` is a linear operator. Stochastic operators (like `P`) are 1-norm expansions. When `v` is multiplied by `gamma` (which is less than 1), `gamma * P * v` becomes a **contraction**. This holds for any norm.
    *   **`R + (gamma * P * v)` (Addition of Rewards)**: Adding a reward term `R` is an **affine operator**, which acts as a **non-expansion** in any norm. It simply shifts the value function without expanding distances.
    *   **`M(...)` (Maximization over Actions)**: The maximization operator `M`, which chooses the best action for each state, is a **non-expansion** specifically for the infinity norm. If a different norm were chosen, `M` would "very likely not [be] a non-expansion".

*   **`v_star` as the Unique Attractive Fixed Point**:
    *   `v_star` is the **only fixed point** of the `T` operator.
    *   Because `T` is a contraction, `v_star` is an **attractive fixed point**, meaning that regardless of where you start in the high-dimensional space of value functions, applying `T` repeatedly will lead you directly to `v_star`. This can be visualized as a "vector field" where following the field always leads to `v_star`, even if the paths might "swirl around". The progress towards `v_star` is guaranteed; there is "no flatness" where progress slows down.

*   **Iteration Complexity of Value Iteration**:
    *   Due to the geometric convergence, the number of iterations (`k`) required to find a `v_k` that is at most `epsilon` away from `v_star` in the infinity norm (`||v_k - v_star||_infinity <= epsilon`) can be easily calculated.
    *   The formula provided is: **`k = log(1/epsilon) / log(1/gamma)`**.
    *   For `gamma` values very close to 1, this can be approximated as `log(1/epsilon) / (1 - gamma)`. This factor `1 / (1 - gamma)` is often referred to as the "effective horizon" or a "blow up factor" because it can be very large when `gamma` is close to 1, indicating that it takes many steps to converge.

*   **Significance in RL Algorithms**:
    *   The ability to calculate an `epsilon`-optimal approximation to `v_star` using Value Iteration is a "reasonable goal" because of the **Policy Error Bound Theorem**. This theorem assures that if your approximate value function `v_k` is sufficiently close to `v_star`, the greedy policy derived from `v_k` (`pi_k`) will be near-optimal, with its suboptimality also bounded. Therefore, Value Iteration provides a computationally feasible path to finding near-optimal policies.


The maximum norm, or infinity norm (`||.||_infinity`), is used extensively in the proofs related to Value Iteration and the policy error bound theorem primarily because **it "happens to work"** for establishing the crucial contraction properties of the Bellman optimality operator `T`.

Here's a breakdown of why the infinity norm is particularly suitable:

*   **Contraction Property of the Bellman Optimality Operator (T):** The core reason for Value Iteration's geometric convergence to the optimal value function `v_star` is that the Bellman optimality operator `T` is a **contraction mapping under the infinity norm**. This means that when `T` is applied, the distance between any two value functions (or a value function and the optimal `v_star`) is reduced by a factor of `gamma` (the discount factor).
    *   The property `||T(v_k) - T(v_star)||_infinity = ||v_{k+1} - v_star||_infinity <= gamma * ||v_k - v_star||_infinity` is fundamental to proving geometric convergence.

*   **Behavior of `T` Operator Components under Infinity Norm:** The `T` operator is a composition of several sub-operations: `T(v) = M(R + gamma * P * v)`. The reason the infinity norm is effective is that each of these constituent operations behaves favorably under it:
    *   **Linear Operator (`gamma * P * v`):** The transition probability matrix `P` applied to `v` is a linear operation. When multiplied by `gamma` (which is less than 1), `gamma * P` becomes a **contraction**. This particular aspect holds true for *any* norm, not just the infinity norm, meaning there's "no restriction there".
    *   **Affine Operator (`R + ...`):** Adding the reward term `R` is an affine operation (a shift) that acts as a **non-expansion** in any norm. It moves the value function without increasing the distance between points.
    *   **Maximization Operator (`M(...)`):** This is the **critical "bottleneck"** where the infinity norm proves indispensable. The `M` operator, which maximizes over actions, is a **non-expansion specifically for the infinity norm**. If "some other norm" were chosen, this maximization operator would "very likely not [be] a non-expansion".

By composing these operators – contractions and non-expansions – the overall `T` operator retains its contraction property under the infinity norm, which is essential for the theoretical guarantees of Value Iteration's convergence and its iteration complexity.


The "bottleneck" mentioned when explaining why the maximum norm (max norm or infinity norm, `||.||_infinity`) is used for proving the contraction property of the Bellman optimality operator `T` lies specifically with the **maximization operator (`M`)**.

To understand this in detail, let's break down the `T` operator and how its components behave under different norms:

*   The Bellman optimality operator `T` is defined as `T(v) = M(R + gamma * P * v)`. This means it involves:
    1.  **Linear transformation (`P * v`):** Applying the transition probability matrix `P` to the value function `v`. When this is multiplied by `gamma` (the discount factor), `gamma * P * v` acts as a **contraction**. This property holds true for **any norm**, meaning there's "no restriction there" from this part of the operation.
    2.  **Affine operation (`R + ...`):** Adding the reward function `R` to the result of the previous step. This is an affine operator (a simple shift) and acts as a **non-expansion** in **any norm**.
    3.  **Maximization operator (`M(...)`):** This operator takes action values (often referred to as Q-values implicitly) and maximizes over actions for each state, returning to the value function space. This is the **critical bottleneck**.

The instructor explicitly states that the maximization operator `M` is a **non-expansion specifically for the infinity norm**. If "some other norm" were chosen, this maximization operator would "very likely not [be] a non-expansion".

Therefore, while the other components of the `T` operator (linear transformation by `gamma * P` and addition of `R`) maintain their desired properties (contraction and non-expansion, respectively) regardless of the chosen norm, the **maximization step necessitates the use of the infinity norm** to ensure that the overall `T` operator remains a contraction mapping. This contraction property is fundamental to proving the geometric convergence of Value Iteration to the unique optimal value function `v_star`.


The maximum norm (or infinity norm, `||.||_infinity`) is utilized in the proof of the Value Iteration theorem primarily because it **"happens to work"** for establishing that the Bellman optimality operator `T` is a **contraction mapping**. This contraction property is fundamental to guaranteeing the geometric convergence of Value Iteration to the unique optimal value function `v_star`.

The Bellman optimality operator `T` is composed of several mathematical operations, expressed as `T(v) = M(R + gamma * P * v)`. To understand why the max norm is crucial, we must examine how each of these component operations behaves under it:

*   **Linear Operator (`gamma * P * v`)**:
    *   The term `P * v` involves applying the transition probability matrix `P` to the value function `v`. `P` is a linear operator.
    *   When `v` is multiplied by the discount factor `gamma` (which is less than 1), the operation `gamma * P * v` becomes a **contraction**.
    *   Crucially, this contraction property of `gamma * P` holds true for **any norm**, meaning there's "no restriction there" from this part of the operation regarding the choice of norm.

*   **Affine Operator (`R + ...`)**:
    *   Adding the reward function `R` to the result of `gamma * P * v` is an **affine operation** (essentially a shift).
    *   This operation acts as a **non-expansion**. Similar to the linear operator, this property holds **in any norm**. It moves the value function without increasing the distance between points in the value space.

*   **Maximization Operator (`M(...)`) - The Bottleneck**:
    *   This is the **critical component** where the infinity norm becomes indispensable.
    *   The `M` operator performs a maximization over actions for each state, effectively selecting the best action based on the current value function.
    *   The instructor explicitly states that the maximization operator `M` is a **non-expansion specifically for the infinity norm**.
    *   If "some other norm" were chosen, this maximization operator would **"very likely not [be] a non-expansion"**. This is the "bottleneck" because, unlike the other components, the maximization step's non-expansion property (which is necessary for the overall `T` operator to be a contraction) is *not* guaranteed under arbitrary norms; it specifically relies on the properties of the infinity norm.

In summary, by composing these operations – a contraction (`gamma * P`), a non-expansion (`R + ...`), and another non-expansion (`M(...)`) that specifically requires the infinity norm – the entire `T` operator is proven to be a **contraction mapping under the infinity norm**. This contraction property is what allows Value Iteration to geometrically converge to the optimal value function, providing the theoretical basis for its effectiveness and allowing for the calculation of its iteration complexity.



When considering **n-step evaluation**, you can think of it as performing **n steps of Value Iteration**. The primary purpose of this approach is to **find the optimal value over a horizon of n**.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Value Iteration Process**: Value Iteration is a computational method that calculates a sequence of value functions, denoted as `v_k`. It starts from an initial value function (e.g., `v_0 = 0`) and iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator `T`. Each application of `T` generates the next value function in the sequence: `v_{k+1} = T(v_k)`.
*   **Progressive Refinement**: Each iteration, or "step," of Value Iteration refines the estimate of the optimal value function. Conceptually, `T(v)` calculates the optimal expected return for the *next* step, assuming subsequent behavior follows the values given by `v`. When `T` is applied `n` times (i.e., `v_n = T^n(v_0)`), it effectively calculates the optimal value over an n-step horizon, often assuming a value of zero beyond that horizon if `v_0` was initialized to zero.
*   **Geometric Convergence**: This iterative process guarantees geometric convergence to the optimal value function `v_star`. This means that the distance between the current value function and the optimal value function, measured by the maximum norm (`||v_k - v_star||_infinity`), decreases by a factor of `gamma` (the discount factor) with each iteration. This rapid reduction in error allows even a finite number of "n steps" to provide a good approximation of `v_star`.
*   **Iteration Complexity and Practical Goals**: The number of iterations `k` required to achieve an epsilon-optimal approximation of `v_star` (i.e., `||v_k - v_star||_infinity <= epsilon`) depends on `gamma` and `epsilon`, and can be calculated using a formula involving `log(1/epsilon)` and `1/(1-gamma)`. The reason for calculating an epsilon-optimal approximation is that it is a "reasonable goal" because it guarantees that the greedy policy derived from this approximation will also be epsilon-optimal, according to the policy error bound theorem.
*   **Connection to Horizon**: The concept of "n-step evaluation" or "n steps of value iteration" implicitly relates to problems with a finite horizon. For instance, if an episode in a reinforcement learning problem is known to terminate within 100 steps, one might only need to run Value Iteration for 100 steps to find the optimal policy for that specific horizon, rather than solving for the infinite horizon problem.

In essence, n-step evaluation provides a way to understand how the Value Iteration algorithm progressively builds up an accurate estimate of the optimal value function by looking further and further into the future with each successive iteration.


Prabhat posed a question regarding the **finite horizon case in Value Iteration** and the **minimum amount of planning needed for an optimal policy**.

Specifically, Prabhat asked:
*   **Regarding finite horizon problems**: Prabhat questioned whether the discussion on iteration complexity also applies to finite horizon cases. He used an example of a fixed horizon of 10,000 steps, asking if it would necessitate 10,000 steps of Value Iteration, or if one could "stop earlier". He then suggested whether calculations could be organized differently, perhaps with "forward draws backwards like back and forth" to reduce computational cost.
*   **Regarding lower bounds and planning horizon overkill**: Building on the discussion of lower bounds and the `1/(1-gamma)` factor, Prabhat inquired if there is a lower bound that depends on a quantity related to `gamma`. He illustrated this with a "small five chain mdp" where changing `gamma` (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.001) doesn't alter the optimal policy's behavior, suggesting that the "planning horizon is overkill" for such a small MDP. He further clarified this by asking, "what's the minimum amount of planning you have to do before your optimal policy stops changing like almost like the behavior of your policy". This question fundamentally probes whether one can achieve the optimal policy with fewer calculations in specific instances, rather than adhering to worst-case bounds.


Prabhat's question delved into two main areas concerning Value Iteration and optimal policies:

1.  **Finite Horizon and Early Stopping**: Prabhat asked if, for a problem with a fixed finite horizon (e.g., 10,000 steps), one would necessarily need to perform 10,000 steps of Value Iteration, or if it might be possible to "stop earlier". He also questioned whether calculations could be organized differently, such as "forward draws backwards like back and forth," to potentially reduce computational cost.
2.  **Lower Bounds, the `1/(1-gamma)` Factor, and "Minimum Planning" for Optimal Policy Behavior**: Prabhat inquired if a lower bound for computation exists that depends on a quantity related to the discount factor `gamma`. He provided an example of a small MDP where the optimal policy's behavior doesn't change even when `gamma` is very small (e.g., 0.1 vs. 0.001), suggesting that for such cases, the "planning horizon is overkill". He rephrased this as wanting to know the "minimum amount of planning you have to do before your optimal policy stops changing".

Here's the instructor's comprehensive answer to Prabhat's queries:

### 1. Finite Horizon and Early Stopping

*   **Finite Horizon Problem Definition**: The instructor clarified that if an episode is known to terminate within a specific number of steps (e.g., 100 steps), it is indeed a **finite horizon problem**, and in such cases, one would not necessarily aim to solve the infinite horizon discounted return maximization problem.
*   **Backwards Induction**: For finite horizon problems, the typical approach involves **backwards induction**, where one solves for the value function at the final step (e.g., H=10,000), then for H=9,999, and so on, back to the initial step. Stopping early in this context would mean not having calculated the necessary values for earlier steps.
*   **Alternative Calculation Organization**: The instructor acknowledged the idea of organizing calculations in "some other ways," such as "forward draws backwards like back and forth," to cut down on computation costs. However, they noted that in the **worst-case scenario**, the `1/(1-gamma)` factor is "real," implying that significant savings in computation for the general case are difficult to achieve.

### 2. Lower Bounds, `1/(1-gamma)`, and "Minimum Planning"

*   **`1/(1-gamma)` as Characteristic Time**: The instructor explained that `1/(1-gamma)` represents a **characteristic time** or effective horizon, indicating "how long does it take roughly to get to your answer" when there's no additional structure to exploit. If `gamma` is very close to one (e.g., `1 - 10^-5`), this factor becomes extremely large (`10^5`), which can make the geometric convergence of Value Iteration appear slow. This factor is also relevant because `gamma` approaching one models the **average reward setting**.
*   **Instance-Dependent Complexity**: The instructor agreed that for "some instances," like Prabhat's small MDP example, the standard "planning horizon is overkill". Prabhat's question about the "minimum amount of planning you have to do before your optimal policy stops changing" was identified as a question of **instance-dependent complexity**. The instructor noted that in the "best case," where rewards are zero, no calculations are needed, so "everything is an overkill".
*   **Difficulty of Proving Instance-Dependent Lower Bounds**: The instructor emphasized that finding the "best runtime no matter what the instance was" is a **"too hard" question**. They compared this challenge to determining the exact computational complexity of matrix multiplication, highlighting that such precise lower bounds are often elusive in computer science. The goal is typically to find arguments that are **algorithm-independent**.
*   **Policy Iteration and Optimal Policy Discovery**: The discussion then shifted to **Policy Iteration** as a contrasting algorithm. Policy Iteration, in a finite number of iterations, can discover an **optimal policy** (not just an epsilon-optimal approximation of the value function). This finite number of iterations depends on the number of states (`S`) and actions (`A`), but notably **does not depend on the `log(1/data)` accuracy factor**.
    *   This implies that if one demands a very high accuracy (i.e., `data` approaches zero), Policy Iteration will "definitely win" over Value Iteration because Value Iteration's complexity includes the `log(1/data)` term, which grows unbounded as `data` goes to zero. Policy Iteration, in contrast, "bumps into" the optimal policy.
*   **Delta Dependence in Lower Bounds**: Regarding whether a `delta` (accuracy) dependence is required in lower bounds, the instructor indicated that the answer "turns out to be no" for finding an optimal policy, referencing the Policy Iteration bound which does not have this dependence. However, there's a nuance: one might need to "incur this extra cost of iterations that the state in action space" to remove the `delta` dependence, suggesting a trade-off.
*   **Worst-Case Factor is Real**: Despite observations about instance-dependent efficiencies, the instructor reiterated that in a **worst-case fashion**, the `1/(1-gamma)` factor remains real and unavoidable.


The runtime of approximate planning with Value Iteration is primarily determined by the **number of iterations required to reach a desired accuracy** and the **computational cost of each iteration**.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Purpose of Value Iteration**: Value Iteration is a method for calculating a sequence of value functions, \(v_k\), by iteratively applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\). It aims to compute an **epsilon-optimal approximation to the optimal value function (\(v_\star\))**. Achieving an epsilon-optimal approximation of \(v_\star\) is considered a reasonable goal because, according to the policy error bound theorem, a policy greedy with respect to this approximation will also be epsilon-optimal.

*   **Iteration Complexity Formula**: The number of iterations, \(k\), needed for Value Iteration to reach a function \(v_k\) that is at most `epsilon` distance from \(v_\star\) (in the maximum norm) is given by:
    \(k \approx \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{ \log(1/\gamma)}\)

    This can often be approximated as:
    \(k \approx \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(1/\epsilon)\)

    This formula shows that the number of iterations depends on two main factors: the desired accuracy (`epsilon`) and the discount factor (`gamma`).

*   **Components of the Runtime:**

    *   **Precision (\(\epsilon\) or `data`)**:
        *   The term \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) (or \(\log(1/\text{data})\) if `data` is used to denote precision) indicates that higher accuracy (smaller `epsilon`) requires more iterations. This logarithmic dependence means that each order of magnitude improvement in accuracy requires a constant additional number of iterations.
        *   The instructor mentioned that for "data optimal policy", this term appears in the complexity.

    *   **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\)) and Effective Horizon**:
        *   The term \(\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\) is often referred to as a **"characteristic time"** or **"effective horizon"**. It signifies "how long does it take roughly to get to your answer in the lack of extra structure".
        *   **As `gamma` approaches 1 (e.g., \(1 - 10^{-5}\)), this factor becomes very large** (e.g., \(10^5\)), indicating that the number of iterations can be substantial. This scenario is particularly relevant when considering **long horizons** or modeling the **average reward setting** (vanishing discount approach).
        *   The instructor stressed that this **"blow up factor is real"** in a worst-case scenario, meaning you can construct examples where this factor is truly needed.

    *   **State Space (S) and Action Space (A)**:
        *   While the iteration complexity formula above gives the *number of iterations*, each iteration of Value Iteration involves calculations over all states and actions.
        *   When considering the total computational cost for finding a near-optimal policy, the number of operations per iteration typically scales with the size of the state space (S) and action space (A). The full estimate for the number of operations is given as: \(S^2 \times A \times \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \times \log(1/\text{data})\).
        *   This accounts for the fact that each Bellman update usually requires iterating through all states and actions.

*   **Geometric Convergence**: Value Iteration exhibits **geometric convergence**. This means that the distance between \(v_k\) and \(v_\star\) decreases by a factor of `gamma` with each iteration. The process "happens pretty fast" if `gamma` is not too close to 1. No matter where you start in the value function space, applying the \(T\) operator will lead you geometrically fast to \(v_\star\), which is the unique attractive fixed point.

*   **Finite Horizon Problems**: For problems with a known finite horizon (e.g., an episode terminating within 100 steps), it's considered a **finite horizon problem**, and the typical approach is **backwards induction**, where calculations are performed from the final step backwards. In such cases, one would not necessarily aim to solve the infinite horizon discounted return problem.

*   **Instance-Dependent Complexity vs. Worst-Case Bounds**: While for "some instances" (like a small MDP where the optimal policy doesn't change even for very small `gamma`), the worst-case planning horizon might seem "overkill", finding the "best runtime no matter what the instance was" is a "too hard" question. The focus is generally on worst-case, algorithm-independent bounds.

*   **Comparison to Policy Iteration**: Policy Iteration is a contrasting algorithm that can find an **optimal policy** (not just an epsilon-optimal approximation of the value function) in a finite number of iterations that depends on S and A, but **does not depend on \(\log(1/\text{data})\)**. This implies that for very high accuracy (where `data` approaches zero), Policy Iteration would "definitely win" over Value Iteration because Value Iteration's complexity grows unboundedly with increasing accuracy. However, for "low accuracy," Value Iteration can be cheaper due to its lower cost per iteration.

*   **Computation Model**: The discussed complexities typically count arithmetic and logic operations (e.g., adding, multiplying, finding the maximum of two numbers each count as one operation). This is distinct from a binary computation model like a Turing machine, where the bit size of inputs matters.


When thinking about calculating a near-optimal policy, the core idea revolves around the relationship between approximating the optimal value function and deriving a policy from that approximation. The general approach often involves **Value Iteration**, but it's crucial to understand its runtime characteristics, its underlying principles, and how it compares to other methods like Policy Iteration.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. The Goal: Approximating the Optimal Value Function

The primary goal is to compute an **epsilon-optimal approximation to the optimal value function (\(v_\star\))**. This is considered a reasonable objective because of a fundamental result in reinforcement learning theory:
*   **Policy Error Bound Theorem**: If you have a value function \(v\) that is "close enough" to the optimal value function \(v_\star\), then the policy derived by acting greedily with respect to \(v\) (a "greedy policy") will also be close to optimal. This is described as a **"continuity design"** or **"sensitivity result"**.
    *   Geometrically, this means if your chosen value function \(v\) is close to \(v_\star\) in the value function space, the value function of the policy \(\pi\) greedy with respect to \(v\) (denoted \(v_\pi\)) will reside within a bounded region around \(v_\star\). Specifically, the distance between \(v_\pi\) and \(v_\star\) is bounded by a factor (related to \(2\gamma/(1-\gamma)\)) times the maximum distance between \(v\) and \(v_\star\). As the distance between \(v\) and \(v_\star\) goes to zero, \(v_\pi\) converges to \(v_\star\).

### 2. Value Iteration: The Core Algorithm for Approximation

Value Iteration is a "super simple way" of calculating a sequence of value functions, \(v_k\), by iteratively applying the **Bellman optimality operator (\(T\))**.
*   **Geometric Convergence**: Value Iteration exhibits **geometric convergence**. This means that the distance between \(v_k\) and \(v_\star\) (in the maximum norm) decreases by a factor of `gamma` with each iteration. Regardless of the starting point, applying the \(T\) operator leads "geometrically fast" to \(v_\star\), which is the unique attractive fixed point of the operator.

#### Runtime and Complexity of Value Iteration:

The runtime of approximate planning with Value Iteration is determined by two main factors: **the number of iterations required to reach a desired accuracy** and **the computational cost of each iteration**.

1.  **Number of Iterations (Iteration Complexity)**:
    *   The number of iterations, \(k\), needed for \(v_k\) to be at most `epsilon` distance from \(v_\star\) (in the maximum norm) is approximately:
        \(k \approx \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(1/\gamma)}\)
    *   This can often be approximated as:
        \(k \approx \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(1/\epsilon)\)
    *   **Precision (\(\epsilon\))**: The \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) term means that higher accuracy (smaller `epsilon`) requires more iterations. This logarithmic dependence implies a constant additional number of iterations for each order of magnitude improvement in accuracy.
    *   **Discount Factor (\(\gamma\)) and "Effective Horizon"**: The \(\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\) factor is a **"characteristic time"** or **"effective horizon"**. It signifies roughly "how long it takes to get to your answer in the lack of extra structure".
        *   When `gamma` is very close to 1 (e.g., \(1 - 10^{-5}\)), this factor becomes very large (e.g., \(10^5\)), indicating a substantial number of iterations. This scenario is particularly relevant when considering **long horizons** or modeling the **average reward setting** (the "vanishing discount approach").
        *   The instructor emphasizes that this **"blow up factor is real" in a worst-case scenario**, meaning examples can be constructed where this factor is truly needed.

2.  **Cost per Iteration**:
    *   Each iteration of Value Iteration involves computations over all states (\(S\)) and actions (\(A\)). The cost per iteration is generally proportional to \(S \times A \times S\) (if transitions are dense, \(S^2 A\)) because for each state, you iterate through actions, and for each action, you sum over possible next states.
    *   **Total Runtime**: The total number of operations for Value Iteration to compute a "data optimal policy" (where "data" refers to the precision `epsilon`) is roughly \(S^2 \times A \times \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \times \log(1/\text{data})\).

### 3. Comparison with Policy Iteration

**Policy Iteration** offers a contrasting approach to finding an optimal policy:
*   **Optimal Policy Discovery**: Unlike Value Iteration, which yields an epsilon-optimal *value function*, Policy Iteration, in a finite number of iterations, can discover an **optimal policy**.
*   **Iteration Count**: The number of iterations for Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy depends on the number of states (\(S\)) and actions (\(A\)), specifically, it's bounded by something like \(S^4 \times A\). Crucially, this bound **does not depend on the \(\log(1/\text{data})\) accuracy factor**.
*   **Trade-offs**:
    *   For **very high accuracy** (when `data` approaches zero), Policy Iteration "definitely wins" because Value Iteration's complexity grows unboundedly with increasing accuracy. Policy Iteration essentially "bumps into" the optimal policy.
    *   However, for **low accuracy**, Value Iteration can be cheaper due to its potentially lower cost per iteration (comparing \(S^2 A\) for Value Iteration versus \(S^3 A^2\) for computing the value of a policy within Policy Iteration).

### 4. Important Considerations for Planning

*   **Finite Horizon Problems**: If an episode is known to terminate within a specific number of steps (e.g., 10,000 steps), it's a **finite horizon problem**, not an infinite horizon discounted return problem. In this case, the typical approach is **backwards induction**, where one solves for the value function at the final step, then for the step before, and so on, back to the initial step. Stopping early in this context would mean not having calculated the necessary values for earlier steps. While alternative calculation organizations (e.g., "forward draws backwards") might be imagined to reduce costs, the worst-case `1/(1-gamma)` factor remains "real".
*   **Instance-Dependent Complexity vs. Worst-Case Bounds**:
    *   The question of finding the "minimum amount of planning you have to do before your optimal policy stops changing" is a matter of **instance-dependent complexity**. For "some instances," like a small MDP where the optimal policy's behavior doesn't change even when `gamma` is very small, the standard "planning horizon is overkill".
    *   However, finding the "best runtime no matter what the instance was" is considered a "too hard" question, similar to determining the exact computational complexity of matrix multiplication. The focus in complexity theory is often on worst-case, algorithm-independent bounds.
*   **Lower Bounds and the `gamma` Dependence**: While Policy Iteration shows that the dependence on `epsilon` (or `data`) is not strictly required for finding an *optimal* policy, the instructor believes that a lower bound for computation would still involve factors related to `S`, `A`, and potentially `1/(1-gamma)`. This is particularly relevant when `gamma` approaches 1 (the average reward setting), where the "span of the optimal value function" or mixing rates might play a role in determining computational difficulty.
*   **Computational Model**: The complexities discussed generally count **arithmetic and logic operations** (e.g., maximum of two numbers, addition, multiplication each count as one operation). This is distinct from a "binary computation model" like a Turing machine, where the bit size of inputs matters.


The instructor discusses normalization in the context of the **average reward setting** and when the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1.

Here's more detail on what the instructor says about normalization:

*   **Context: \(\gamma\) approaching 1 and Average Reward**
    *   When the discount factor \(\gamma\) gets very close to 1 (e.g., \(1 - 10^{-5}\)), the term \(1/(1-\gamma)\) becomes very large (e.g., \(10^5\)). This factor is referred to as a "characteristic time" or "effective horizon".
    *   In this scenario, the value function \(v_\pi\) (the value of a policy \(\pi\)) can become very large. For example, if you get a reward of 1 at every step, the total discounted reward can be as high as \(1/(1-\gamma)\). This unnormalized value function "could be as large as one over one minus gamma".
    *   The case where \(\gamma\) goes to 1 is also referred to as the **"vanishing discount approach"** and is a way to model the **average reward setting**.

*   **What is Normalized and How**
    *   To deal with the potentially large values of \(v_\pi\) as \(\gamma\) approaches 1, one might **"normalize it" by pre-multiplying with \((1-\gamma)\)**. This means instead of considering \(v_\pi\), you would look at \((1-\gamma) v_\pi\).

*   **The Intuition Behind Normalization**
    *   The instructor provides an intuition for this normalization: You can think of \((1-\gamma)\) as a normalizing factor for a **geometric probability distribution**.
    *   Specifically, if you consider picking a time point \(k\) with probability \(\gamma^k\), then \((1-\gamma)\) is the normalizing factor to make this a proper probability distribution.
    *   Therefore, pre-multiplying the value function by \((1-\gamma)\) is akin to **calculating a weighted average over time**. If there is "sufficient structure" and "regularity in the MDP," as \(\gamma\) goes to 1, this normalized quantity will converge to the value function for the average reward.

*   **Relevance to "Hot Instances" and Lower Bounds**
    *   The instructor suggests that in the average reward literature, there's an indication that the large \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor (or something analogous, like a "mixing rate") is "real" in terms of computational difficulty.
    *   In MDPs that are "not too nice," the "span of the optimal value function" (or similar quantities) might "explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1. These are considered "hot instances" where calculations would take longer.
    *   Conversely, "easier instances" are those where this span is kept finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.

In essence, normalization helps to manage the scale of value functions in long-horizon or average reward problems, where values can otherwise become unbounded as the discount factor approaches one, and it provides a way to interpret the discounted sum as an average.




The concept of normalization becomes particularly important when considering the **average reward setting** or when the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1. This scenario is often referred to as the **"vanishing discount approach"**.

### Unnormalized Value Functions and the Challenge of \(\gamma \to 1\)

*   When the discount factor \(\gamma\) is very close to 1, the term \(1/(1-\gamma)\) can become very large. For example, if \(\gamma = 1 - 10^{-5}\), then \(1/(1-\gamma)\) is \(10^5\). This factor represents a **"characteristic time"** or **"effective horizon"**, indicating roughly "how long it takes to get to your answer in the lack of extra structure".
*   In this scenario, the **unnormalized value function** \(v_\pi\) for a given policy \(\pi\) can also become very large. The instructor states that the value function "could be as large as one over one minus gamma" if, for instance, you receive a reward of 1 at every step. This unbounded growth in value functions as \(\gamma\) approaches 1 presents a computational challenge.

### Normalization of Value Functions

*   To address the issue of exploding value function magnitudes when \(\gamma\) approaches 1, one can **"normalize"** the value function.
*   **How to Normalize**: This is done by **pre-multiplying the value function \(v_\pi\) by \((1-\gamma)\)**. So, instead of working with \(v_\pi\), you would consider \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\).
*   **Intuition Behind Normalization**: The factor \((1-\gamma)\) can be thought of as a **normalizing factor for a geometric probability distribution**. If you consider picking a time point \(k\) with probability \(\gamma^k\), then \((1-\gamma)\) is the factor that makes this a proper probability distribution. Therefore, pre-multiplying \(v_\pi\) by \((1-\gamma)\) is analogous to calculating a **weighted average over time**.

### Convergence to the Average Reward Value Function

*   If the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has **"sufficient structure"** and **"regularity"**, then as \(\gamma\) approaches 1, this **normalized quantity, \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\), will converge to the value function for the average reward setting**. This is precisely why the vanishing discount approach is used to model average reward problems.

### Implications for Computational Complexity

*   The relationship between the discounted setting (as \(\gamma \to 1\)) and the average reward setting has significant implications for computational complexity, particularly concerning **lower bounds** on the number of operations needed for planning.
*   **The "Blow Up Factor is Real"**: The instructor emphasizes that the large \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor, reflecting the "characteristic time," is **"real" in a worst-case scenario** for computational difficulty. There are instances where this factor truly reflects the required computational effort.
*   **Average Reward Literature and Lower Bounds**: Although the average reward setting doesn't directly have a discount factor, the literature in this area suggests that a related quantity, such as the **"mixing rate"** of the MDP or the **"span of the optimal value function"**, plays a similar role in determining computational difficulty.
*   **"Hot Instances" vs. "Easier Instances"**:
    *   For MDPs that are **"not too nice,"** the span of the optimal value function (or similar quantities for normalized value functions) can **"explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**. These are considered **"hot instances"** where calculations would take longer.
    *   Conversely, **"easier instances"** are those MDPs where the span is kept finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.
*   The instructor notes that while there's indication in the average reward literature that such a lower bound involving these factors is "real," a very clean presentation of this result for the discounted setting is not commonly found, despite the fundamental nature of the question.




The **vanishing discount approach** is a method used in reinforcement learning theory where the **discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1**. This approach is primarily used to think about the **long horizon case** or to model the **average reward setting**.

Here are the full details on the vanishing discount approach:

*   **Motivation: Unbounded Value Functions**
    *   When the discount factor \(\gamma\) is very close to 1 (e.g., \(1 - 10^{-5}\)), the term **\(1/(1-\gamma)\) becomes extremely large**. This factor is referred to as a **"characteristic time"** or **"effective horizon"**.
    *   In this scenario, the **unnormalized value function** \(v_\pi\) for a policy \(\pi\) can also become very large, potentially "as large as one over one minus gamma" if, for example, a reward of 1 is received at every step. This unbounded growth presents a challenge for analysis and computation.

*   **Normalization as a Solution**
    *   To manage the scale of these value functions as \(\gamma\) approaches 1, one can **"normalize it" by pre-multiplying with \((1-\gamma)\)**. Instead of considering \(v_\pi\), you would analyze **\((1-\gamma)v_\pi\)**.
    *   The instructor explains the intuition: \((1-\gamma)\) acts as a **normalizing factor for a geometric probability distribution**. If you consider picking a time point \(k\) with probability \(\gamma^k\), then \((1-\gamma)\) ensures this is a proper probability distribution. Thus, pre-multiplying the value function by \((1-\gamma)\) effectively calculates a **"weighted average over time"**.

*   **Connection to the Average Reward Setting**
    *   The vanishing discount approach is fundamentally linked to the **average reward setting**. If the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has "sufficient structure" and "regularity," the **normalized quantity, \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\), will converge to the value function for the average reward** as \(\gamma\) goes to 1.
    *   It's important to note that the average reward setting itself **does not have a discount factor**.

*   **Implications for Computational Complexity and Lower Bounds**
    *   The instructor stresses that the large factor of \(1/(1-\gamma)\) is **"real" in worst-case computational scenarios**. This means it reflects a genuine computational difficulty.
    *   While the average reward literature doesn't use \(\gamma\) directly, it suggests that quantities like the **"mixing rate"** of the MDP or the **"span of the optimal value function"** play a similar role in determining computational difficulty.
    *   **"Hot instances"** are MDPs that are "not too nice," where the span of the optimal value function can **"explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**, implying that calculations will take longer.
    *   Conversely, **"easier instances"** are those MDPs where this span remains finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.
    *   Despite its fundamental nature, a very clear presentation of a lower bound involving this \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor for the discounted setting is "not commonly found".


When Vlad mentions "mixing" in relation to the discount factor \(\gamma\), he is referring to the **mixing rate of the Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, which plays a role analogous to the large \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor in the average reward setting.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

*   **Average Reward Setting and its Analogy to Discounted Problems**: The average reward setting, unlike discounted problems, does not inherently have a discount factor. However, the "vanishing discount approach," where the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1, is often used to model or understand the average reward setting. In this context, the behavior of the value function as \(\gamma \to 1\) is crucial.
*   **The Role of Span in Convergence**: For the normalized value function, \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\), to converge to the average reward value function as \(\gamma\) approaches 1 (a process described as having "sufficient structure" and "regularity" in the MDP), it is necessary for the **"span of the value function" (specifically, the optimal value function)** to remain bounded.
*   **Mixing Rate as a Fundamental Quantity**: The instructor states that the **mixing rate** of the MDP is a "more fundamental quantity" than the discount factor itself, and it is related to the **span of the optimal value function**.
*   **Computational Difficulty and "Hot Instances"**:
    *   In MDPs that are "not too nice," the **span of the optimal value function can "explode"** as \(\gamma\) goes to 1. These are characterized as **"hot instances"** where calculations for finding optimal policies would take longer. The instructor emphasizes that the large \(1/(1-\gamma)\) "blow up factor is real" in such worst-case scenarios for computational difficulty.
    *   Conversely, **"easier instances"** are those where the span is kept finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.
*   **Lower Bounds in Average Reward Literature**: In the average reward literature, there's an indication that quantities like the mixing rate or something related to the span are involved in **lower bounds** for computational complexity. This suggests that the inherent difficulty of these problems is tied to how quickly the MDP "mixes" or reaches its steady state, which is reflected in the span of the value function.

In summary, while the average reward setting lacks a discount factor, its connection to the vanishing discount approach highlights that the **mixing rate of an MDP, often expressed through the "span of the value function," becomes a critical factor determining both the convergence properties and the inherent computational complexity** for long-horizon and average reward problems.

The **mixing rate of a Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a crucial concept, particularly when considering the average reward setting and the computational complexity associated with solving MDPs for long horizons. It acts as a more fundamental quantity that influences how quickly an MDP reaches its steady state.

Here are the details regarding the mixing rate of an MDP:

*   **Analogy to the Discount Factor in Average Reward Setting**: In the average reward setting, which inherently does not have a discount factor, the concept of a "mixing rate" emerges as a counterpart to the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor found in discounted problems as \(\gamma\) approaches 1. The "vanishing discount approach," where \(\gamma\) goes to 1, is used to model the average reward setting.
*   **Connection to the Span of the Optimal Value Function**: Vlad clarifies that the mixing rate is **"a more fundamental quantity"** that is directly related to the **"span of the optimal value function"**. The span refers to the range of values the optimal value function can take across different states.
*   **Role in Convergence**: For the normalized value function, \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\), to converge to the average reward value function as \(\gamma\) approaches 1, the MDP needs to have "sufficient structure" and "regularity". A key aspect of this regularity is that the **span of the normalized value functions must remain bounded as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**.
*   **Implications for Computational Complexity**:
    *   The large factor of \(1/(1-\gamma)\), which represents a "characteristic time" or "effective horizon" for calculations, is **"real" in worst-case computational scenarios**. This means that the computational difficulty can genuinely "blow up".
    *   For MDPs that are **"not too nice,"** the span of the optimal value function can **"explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**. These are referred to as **"hot instances,"** and finding optimal policies for them will take longer due to the large span.
    *   Conversely, **"easier instances"** are MDPs where the span remains finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.
*   **Lower Bounds in Average Reward Literature**: The average reward literature suggests that quantities like the mixing rate or something related to the span are involved in **lower bounds for computational complexity**. This implies that there are inherent limits to how quickly these problems can be solved, and these limits are tied to the MDP's mixing properties. Vlad notes that a very clean presentation of this result for the discounted setting is "not commonly found," despite the fundamental nature of the question.

In essence, the mixing rate (via the span of the value function) is a critical property of an MDP that dictates how quickly information propagates and how difficult it is to find optimal policies, especially in long-horizon or average reward scenarios, playing a role analogous to the inverse of the discount factor's proximity to one.

The computational complexity of planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is a multifaceted topic, with discussions revolving around how various factors, including the discount factor and the structure of the MDP, influence the minimum number of operations required to find a solution. The provided sources delve into theoretical lower bounds, their relation to different solution algorithms, and the fundamental properties of MDPs.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Counting Computational Operations**: When discussing the complexity of algorithms for MDPs, the operations counted are typically **arithmetic and logic operations** (e.g., max of two numbers, adding two numbers, multiplying two numbers all count as one operation). This is distinct from a binary computation model like a Turing machine, where the size of the input in bits matters.

*   **The Role of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) Factor (Effective Horizon)**:
    *   For discounted infinite horizon problems, the term \(1/(1-\gamma)\) is considered a **"characteristic time"** or **"effective horizon"**. It indicates roughly how long it takes to reach an answer in the absence of extra structure in the MDP.
    *   When the discount factor \(\gamma\) is very close to 1 (e.g., \(1 - 10^{-5}\)), this factor becomes very large (e.g., \(10^5\)), implying a potentially huge computational cost.
    *   Vlad emphasizes that this **"blow up factor is real"** in worst-case computational scenarios, meaning one can construct examples where this large factor genuinely represents the computational difficulty.

*   **Connection to the Vanishing Discount and Average Reward Settings**:
    *   The **vanishing discount approach**, where \(\gamma\) approaches 1, is used to model the **long horizon case** or the **average reward setting**.
    *   In the average reward setting, there is no inherent discount factor. However, the lower bounds in average reward literature implicitly suggest the reality of this large factor.

*   **Mixing Rate and Span of the Optimal Value Function**:
    *   In the average reward setting, the **"mixing rate" of the MDP is a more fundamental quantity** that determines computational difficulty.
    *   This mixing rate is related to the **"span of the optimal value function"**. The span refers to the range of values the optimal value function can take across different states.
    *   For the normalized value function \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\) to converge to the average reward value function as \(\gamma \to 1\), the span of the normalized value functions must remain bounded.
    *   **"Hot instances"** are MDPs that are "not too nice," where the span of the optimal value function can **"explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**, making calculations take longer.
    *   **"Easier instances"** are MDPs where the span remains finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.
    *   The average reward literature indicates that something related to the span is involved in **lower bounds for computational complexity**. Despite its fundamental nature, a very clear presentation of this result for the *discounted* setting is "not commonly found".

*   **Specific Lower Bounds Mentioned**:
    *   One lower bound states that to get an answer, you have to touch **"basically every state action pair S times"**. This lower bound is expressed in terms of the number of elementary arithmetic operations.
    *   **This specific lower bound "has no gamma here and the data dependence is not shown either"**. This raises the question of whether a lower bound *should* depend on accuracy (data).

*   **Accuracy (Epsilon) Dependence and Algorithm Comparison**:
    *   For value iteration, the number of iterations required to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation is roughly \(S^2 A / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\epsilon)\). This shows a dependence on \(\log(1/\epsilon)\), meaning higher accuracy (smaller \(\epsilon\)) requires more iterations.
    *   For **policy iteration**, the number of iterations required to discover an *optimal* policy (not just \(\epsilon\)-optimal) is given as \(S^4 \times S^3 A^2 \times H\), where H is related to \(1/(1-\gamma)\). Crucially, **this bound on policy iteration for finding an *optimal* policy does *not* explicitly depend on \(\epsilon\) (data)**. This is because once the accuracy is small enough to demand the optimal policy, policy iteration finds it without further dependence on the specific \(\epsilon\) value.
    *   This implies that for **very high accuracy, policy iteration often wins** because its bound is not unbounded with \(\log(1/\epsilon)\). However, for low accuracy, value iteration might be cheaper per iteration and win.
    *   The "Heaven and Hell MDP" example was used to demonstrate an **algorithm-independent lower bound**, suggesting that any algorithm cannot avoid reading all input numbers.

*   **Overall Difficulty in Proving Exact Lower Bounds**:
    *   Proving exact lower bounds for MDPs is extremely challenging. Vlad draws an analogy to matrix multiplication, where even for fundamental problems, the exact exponent of complexity (e.g., whether it's \(d^3\) or \(d^{2.37...}\)) is still unknown.
    *   The difficulty increases when considering instance-dependent complexities or trying to find a "best runtime no matter what the instance was".
    *   The way probability tables (transition probabilities) are represented can also affect calculation speed, further complicating the analysis of lower bounds.

In essence, while there's a strong theoretical indication that the computational cost for planning in MDPs (especially in worst-case, long-horizon scenarios) scales with the "effective horizon" \(1/(1-\gamma)\) and the size of the state and action spaces, a universally "clean" and tight lower bound proof that precisely captures all these dependencies, particularly for the discounted setting, remains an active area of discussion and research.

The reason there is **no data dependence** (i.e., dependence on \(\epsilon\), the desired precision or sub-optimality level) in the lower bound for the computational complexity of planning in MDPs stems from the behavior of **policy iteration**.

Here's a detailed explanation:

*   **The Lower Bound and Data Dependence**: A general lower bound mentioned indicates that an algorithm must touch "basically every state action pair S times". This lower bound, expressed in terms of elementary arithmetic operations, "has no gamma here and the data dependence is not shown either". The question then arises: "should there be a data dependence?" and the source states, "the answer turns out to be no".

*   **Policy Iteration's Role**: The absence of data dependence is explained by considering how policy iteration works in contrast to value iteration:
    *   **Value Iteration's Dependence on Accuracy**: For value iteration, the number of iterations required to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation to the optimal value function is roughly \(S^2 A / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\epsilon)\). This explicitly shows a **logarithmic dependence on \(1/\epsilon\)** (the inverse of the precision), meaning that as you demand higher accuracy (smaller \(\epsilon\)), the number of iterations (and thus operations) increases.
    *   **Policy Iteration's Independence from Accuracy (for optimality)**: Policy iteration operates differently. It starts with a policy, evaluates its value function, then "greedifies" to find a new policy, and repeats. A key property of policy iteration is that **"after only this many iterations it discovers a policy which is optimal"**. The bound on the number of iterations for policy iteration to find an *optimal* policy is given as \(S^4 \times S^3 A^2 \times H\) (where \(H\) is related to \(1/(1-\gamma)\)), and **crucially, this bound does *not* explicitly depend on \(\epsilon\)**.
    *   **Why the Difference?**: The instructor clarifies that once the accuracy (data) is "small enough" to effectively demand the *optimal policy*, policy iteration will find that optimal policy without further increasing its computational effort based on \(\epsilon\). It's as if it "bumps into that" optimal policy like a "magnet". This means that for "really really high accuracy," policy iteration "definitely wins" because its bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)". In other words, while value iteration needs more steps to refine its approximation to an ever-smaller \(\epsilon\), policy iteration reaches a point where it identifies the *exact* optimal policy, and beyond that, the notion of \(\epsilon\)-optimality becomes less relevant for its convergence.

In essence, the argument is that for finding a truly *optimal* policy (as opposed to just an \(\epsilon\)-optimal one), the concept of data dependence (or \(\epsilon\)) in the lower bound vanishes because algorithms like policy iteration can converge to the exact optimal policy within a bound that is independent of how finely you specify the required precision.

The sources indicate that in the context of planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly for the average reward setting or when the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1 (the "vanishing discount approach"), **the mixing rate of the MDP is considered a more fundamental quantity that determines computational difficulty**.

The source then clarifies that this mixing rate is closely associated with, and even identified as, **"the span of the value function span of the optimal value function"**. Therefore, rather than the span being *more* fundamental than the mixing rate, the source presents them as intertwined or perhaps interchangeable concepts that capture the inherent difficulty of an MDP.

Here's why the span (as a characteristic of the mixing rate) is considered fundamental to computational complexity:

*   **Definition of Span**: The span refers to the **range of values the optimal value function can take across different states**. It essentially measures how much the value of being in one state can differ from being in another state, according to the optimal policy.

*   **Convergence and Normalization**: When considering the vanishing discount approach, where \(\gamma\) approaches 1, the goal is often to understand the long-horizon behavior, which relates to the average reward setting. For the normalized value function, \((1-\gamma)v_\pi\), to converge to the average reward value function as \(\gamma \to 1\), a crucial condition is that **the span of these normalized value functions must remain bounded**.

*   **Instance Difficulty ("Hot Instances")**:
    *   In MDPs that are "not too nice," referred to as **"hot instances," the span of the optimal value function can "explode" as \(\gamma\) goes to 1**. This means the difference between the highest and lowest possible values becomes extremely large. When the span explodes, it signifies that calculations will take longer.
    *   Conversely, **"easier instances"** are those MDPs where the span remains finite as \(\gamma\) approaches 1.

*   **Relation to Lower Bounds**: The average reward literature, which is closely related to the \(\gamma \to 1\) case, indicates that **"something related to the span is involved in lower bounds for computational complexity"**. This suggests that the inherent difficulty of solving an MDP to find an optimal policy is directly tied to this quantity, regardless of the specific algorithm used.

In summary, the span of the optimal value function is fundamental because its behavior (remaining bounded or exploding as \(\gamma \to 1\)) directly dictates the inherent computational difficulty of an MDP, particularly in long-horizon or average reward scenarios, and is implicated in the theoretical lower bounds for planning complexity.


The "best case" scenario for the computational complexity of planning in MDPs is considered **trivial** and, in a sense, means **no calculations are necessary**.

This extreme best case occurs when:
*   **Rewards are identically zero**: If all rewards are zero, then "every policy is doing equally well". In such a scenario, there is no need to perform any complex calculations to find an optimal policy, as any policy is effectively optimal. The instructor states, "you shouldn't do any calculations right like the best case you don't have to do calculations that's kind of silly".

This contrasts sharply with the discussion around worst-case complexities, where the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor (the "effective horizon") is highlighted as a "real" blow-up factor that can lead to significant computational costs. While the sources also mention "easier instances" of MDPs where the span of the optimal value function remains finite as the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches 1, this refers to specific structures that might alleviate some computational burden, rather than a scenario where no calculations are needed at all. The absolute "best case" is reserved for the most trivial MDPs.

Policy iteration is a fundamental method for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to find an optimal policy. It operates through an iterative process that **alternates between evaluating a policy and improving it**.

Here's a breakdown of what policy iteration is and how it works:

*   **Iterative Process**: Policy iteration starts with an initial policy. It then proceeds through a cycle of two main steps:
    1.  **Policy Evaluation**: Given the current policy, it computes its exact value function. This involves solving a system of linear equations, which can be computationally intensive for large state spaces.
    2.  **Policy Improvement (Greedification)**: Based on the computed value function, a new, improved policy is derived by choosing the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value for each state. This is often referred to as "greedifying" the policy with respect to the current value function.
    The process then repeats: evaluate the new policy, then improve it, and so on.

*   **Convergence to Optimality**: A key characteristic of policy iteration is that it is guaranteed to discover an **optimal policy** within a finite number of iterations, provided ties in the greedy operation are resolved systematically. This means that if multiple actions yield the same maximum value during the greedification step, the algorithm must consistently choose one (e.g., always picking the first one) to avoid "jittering".

*   **Contrast with Value Iteration**: Policy iteration differs significantly from value iteration, especially concerning the precision required for convergence to an optimal policy:
    *   **Value Iteration's Precision Dependence**: Value iteration calculates a sequence of value functions that converge to the optimal value function, typically achieving an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation. The number of iterations for value iteration to reach an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation depends logarithmically on \(1/\epsilon\) (e.g., \(S^2 A / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\epsilon)\)). This means that as you demand higher accuracy (smaller \(\epsilon\)), the computational effort for value iteration increases.
    *   **Policy Iteration's Independence from Precision (for optimality)**: In contrast, policy iteration, "after only this many iterations it discovers a policy which is optimal". The number of iterations (and thus operations) for policy iteration to find an *optimal* policy is bounded by roughly \(S^4 \times S^3 A^2 \times H\) (where \(H\) is the effective horizon, approximately \(1/(1-\gamma)\)). Crucially, **this bound does not explicitly depend on \(\epsilon\) or \(\delta\) (sub-optimality level)**.

*   **Computational Advantage for High Accuracy**: For "really really high accuracy," policy iteration "definitely wins" because its computational bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)". This is because it directly finds the optimal policy, essentially "bumping into" it like a "magnet". While value iteration might be cheaper for "low accuracy" scenarios due to its simpler per-iteration cost, policy iteration's ability to find the *exact* optimal policy without increasing iterations for arbitrarily high precision makes it superior for tasks demanding true optimality.

*   **Historical Context**: Policy iteration was discovered by a person named Howard, who also wrote significant works on probability theory and MDPs.


The runtime bound for policy iteration, including the cost of computing the value function, is given as a number of elementary arithmetic operations.

The runtime estimate is:
*   **S to the power of 4 times S cubed A squared times H**.

Let's break down the components of this bound:
*   **S**: Represents the number of states in the MDP.
*   **A**: Represents the number of actions in the MDP.
*   **H**: This refers to the **effective horizon**, which is approximately **1 divided by (1 - gamma)** (where gamma is the discount factor). This means the bound can also be expressed as \(S^4 \times S^3 A^2 \times \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\).

A crucial characteristic of policy iteration is that it **discovers an optimal policy** within this many iterations. This is unlike value iteration, whose number of iterations to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation explicitly depends on \(\log(1/\epsilon)\). For policy iteration, the bound for finding an *optimal* policy does **not explicitly depend on the precision (\(\epsilon\) or \(\delta\))**.

This independence from precision means that for "really really high accuracy," policy iteration "definitely wins" over value iteration because its bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)". The only condition for policy iteration to guarantee optimality within this bound is that **ties in the greedy operation must be resolved in a systematic manner**.



Between roughly 50:00 and 55:00, the discussion primarily focuses on the **computational complexity of finding an optimal policy in MDPs**, specifically addressing the nature of **lower bounds** and the role of **policy iteration** in determining the presence (or absence) of data dependence in these bounds.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

*   **Lower Bounds and Data Dependence**: The discussion begins by revisiting a general lower bound for computational complexity, which states that an algorithm must effectively "touch every state action pair S times". This lower bound is expressed in terms of elementary arithmetic operations and notably "has no gamma here and the data dependence is not shown either". The fundamental question posed is whether "should there be a data dependence" on the sub-optimality level (often denoted as \(\delta\) or \(\epsilon\)) in this lower bound. The speaker asserts that "the answer turns out to be no".

*   **Policy Iteration as the Explanation**:
    *   To explain why there is no data dependence, **policy iteration** is introduced and contrasted with value iteration.
    *   For value iteration, achieving an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation of the optimal value function requires a number of iterations that includes a **logarithmic dependence on \(1/\epsilon\)** (e.g., \(S^2 A / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\text{data})\)). This means that as you demand higher precision (smaller \(\epsilon\)), the number of iterations increases.
    *   Policy iteration, on the other hand, is highlighted because "after only this many iterations it discovers a policy which is optimal". This convergence to an *optimal* policy happens within a finite number of iterations, provided that "ties have to be resolved in a systematic manner" during the greedy operation.

*   **Runtime Bound for Policy Iteration**:
    *   The **runtime bound** for policy iteration, including the cost of computing the value function, is given as approximately **S to the power of 4 times S cubed A squared times H**. Here, 'S' is the number of states, 'A' is the number of actions, and 'H' is the effective horizon, approximately \(1/(1-\gamma)\).
    *   Crucially, this bound for policy iteration **does not explicitly depend on the precision or sub-optimality level (data)**. This is the core reason for the "no data dependence" answer regarding the lower bound.
    *   The speaker emphasizes that "for really really high accuracy policy iteration definitely wins" compared to value iteration, because policy iteration's bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)". Policy iteration finds the exact optimal policy, effectively "bumping into that it's like a magnet". While value iteration might be more efficient for "low accuracy" scenarios due to cheaper per-iteration costs, policy iteration's ability to find the *exact* optimal policy without increasing iterations for arbitrarily high precision makes it superior for true optimality.

*   **Computational Complexity as a Broader Challenge**: The discussion briefly touches upon the general difficulty of determining exact computational complexity bounds, drawing an analogy to **matrix multiplication** where the exact exponent for multiplication runtime is still unknown despite existing upper bounds. This highlights that finding precise lower bounds and matching them with upper bounds for algorithms in MDPs is a complex task, often influenced by representation choices and specific instance characteristics.


Policy iteration is guaranteed to discover an **optimal policy** after a specific number of iterations, provided certain conditions are met.

The number of operations (and by extension, iterations) required for policy iteration to find an optimal policy is estimated as:
*   **S to the power of 4 times S cubed A squared times H**.

Breaking this down:
*   **S** represents the number of **states** in the Markov Decision Process (MDP).
*   **A** represents the number of **actions** in the MDP.
*   **H** refers to the **effective horizon**, which is approximately **1 divided by (1 - gamma)**, where gamma is the discount factor.

Therefore, the runtime bound can also be expressed as \(S^4 \times S^3 A^2 \times \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\). This means that policy iteration "discovers a policy which is optimal" within this bound of operations.

A crucial point is that this bound ensures the discovery of an *optimal* policy, not just an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation like value iteration. This is why, for "really really high accuracy," policy iteration "definitely wins" because its computational bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)".

However, there is a condition for this guarantee: **ties in the greedy operation must be resolved in a systematic manner**. This means if multiple actions yield the same maximum value during the policy improvement step, the algorithm must consistently choose one (e.g., always picking the first one) to prevent "jittering" and ensure convergence.

The difference between "high accuracy" and "low accuracy" iteration in the context of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) primarily pertains to the **computational methods employed and their respective runtime characteristics**. This distinction is best understood by comparing **Value Iteration (VI)** and **Policy Iteration (PI)**.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

*   **Definition of Accuracy**:
    *   Accuracy, in this context, refers to how close the found policy's value function is to the true optimal value function. It is often quantified by a small number, \(\epsilon\) (epsilon) or \(\delta\) (delta), representing the sub-optimality level. A "high accuracy" requirement means a very small \(\epsilon\) or \(\delta\), demanding a policy that is extremely close to optimal, while "low accuracy" implies a larger, more permissible margin of error.

*   **Value Iteration (VI) and Accuracy Dependence**:
    *   **Goal**: Value iteration computes a sequence of value functions that converge to the optimal value function, \(V^*\). It typically aims to find an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation of \(V^*\).
    *   **Iteration Complexity**: The number of iterations required for Value Iteration to reach an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation explicitly depends on \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) (or \(\log(1/\text{data})\), where data refers to the precision). Specifically, the runtime is estimated as \(S^2 A / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\text{data})\).
    *   **Implication for Accuracy**: This logarithmic dependence means that as you demand **higher accuracy** (i.e., smaller \(\epsilon\)), the computational effort for value iteration **increases significantly**. Conversely, for **low accuracy**, Value Iteration can be more efficient due to its simpler per-iteration cost.

*   **Policy Iteration (PI) and Accuracy Independence (for Optimality)**:
    *   **Goal**: Policy iteration directly finds an **optimal policy**. It does not merely approximate the optimal value function but rather "discovers a policy which is optimal".
    *   **Iteration Complexity**: The runtime bound for Policy Iteration to find an *optimal* policy is given as approximately **S to the power of 4 times S cubed A squared times H** (where H is the effective horizon, \(1/(1-\gamma)\)).
    *   **Implication for Accuracy**: Crucially, this bound for Policy Iteration **does not explicitly depend on the precision or sub-optimality level (\(\epsilon\) or \(\delta\))**. Policy Iteration effectively "bumps into" the optimal policy, like a "magnet," once a certain number of operations are performed.
    *   **Condition**: For this guarantee, "ties have to be resolved in a systematic manner" during the greedy policy improvement step.

*   **Trade-off between VI and PI based on Accuracy**:
    *   **High Accuracy Scenarios**: For "really really high accuracy," **Policy Iteration definitely wins**. This is because its computational bound is "not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)", meaning it doesn't incur additional costs for increasingly precise demands once it's on the path to optimality. It directly finds the optimal policy.
    *   **Low Accuracy Scenarios**: For "low accuracy," **Value Iteration could win**. This is due to its lower per-iteration cost and ability to make "pretty fast progress" even with less precise value function estimates.

In essence, Value Iteration is often preferred for finding "low accuracy" or approximate solutions efficiently, while Policy Iteration is more powerful when the goal is to find the "high accuracy" or true optimal policy, as its computational cost does not explode with the demand for higher precision.



Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, **the term "delta" (or "data") is not discussed as a component to be included in the fundamental definition of a Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. Instead, "delta" refers to the **desired precision or sub-optimality level** when aiming to find a near-optimal policy or value function.

Here's how "delta" is discussed in the context of solving MDPs:

*   **Precision for Near-Optimality**: When solving an MDP, an algorithm might aim to find a policy whose value function is within a certain "delta" (or "epsilon") distance from the true optimal value function. This "delta" quantifies the acceptable level of sub-optimality or inaccuracy.
*   **Impact on Value Iteration Runtime**: The computational complexity of **Value Iteration** to achieve a "delta"-optimal policy *does* explicitly depend on this precision level. Specifically, the runtime is given as proportional to \(\text{S}^2 \text{A} / (1-\gamma) \times \log(1/\text{data})\) (where "data" is used interchangeably with "delta" for precision). This implies that demanding higher accuracy (a smaller "delta") significantly increases the computational effort for Value Iteration due to the logarithmic term.
*   **Policy Iteration's Independence from Precision**: In contrast, **Policy Iteration** is highlighted because it directly "discovers a policy which is optimal" within a finite number of iterations, estimated as \(\text{S}^4 \times \text{S}^3 \text{A}^2 \times \text{H}\) (where \(\text{H}\) is the effective horizon, approximately \(1/(1-\gamma)\)). Crucially, this bound for Policy Iteration **does not explicitly depend on "delta"**. This leads to the conclusion that for "really really high accuracy," Policy Iteration "definitely wins" because its bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)" (or log(1/data)).
*   **Lower Bounds and Data Dependence**: The discussion also touches upon whether the theoretical lower bounds for computing an optimal policy should include a data (or delta) dependence. The speaker states that the answer "turns out to be no" because Policy Iteration can find an optimal policy without this dependence.

Therefore, "delta" is a parameter that defines the desired **quality of the *solution*** rather than being a part of the fundamental mathematical definition of an MDP itself.

Based on the sources and our conversation, your interpretation that **delta (the precision on near-optimality) is not required if we are willing to "incur state squared times actions in terms of iteration" is not entirely correct**, and the speaker directly addresses this nuance.

Here's a breakdown of why, drawing from the discussion:

*   **Speaker's Direct Correction:** When you posed this exact phrasing, the speaker responded, **"I wouldn't phrase it like that"**. This indicates that your statement, while touching on related concepts, misrepresents the precise relationship between precision and iteration costs for different algorithms.
*   **Value Iteration (VI) and Delta Dependence:**
    *   For **Value Iteration**, the computational complexity to calculate an **epsilon-optimal approximation** (where epsilon is your 'delta' or 'data' for precision) of the optimal value function *does* explicitly depend on this precision level.
    *   The approximate runtime for Value Iteration is given as **`S^2 A / (1-gamma) * log(1/data)`**.
    *   Therefore, if you are using Value Iteration to achieve a certain precision, then **'delta' (or 'data') *is* required**, and a higher precision (smaller delta) leads to more iterations due to the `log(1/data)` term.
*   **Policy Iteration (PI) and Independence from Delta for Optimality:**
    *   In contrast, **Policy Iteration** is highlighted because it directly "discovers a policy which is optimal". It finds the *exact* optimal policy, not just an approximation.
    *   The **runtime bound for Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy** is estimated as **`S^4 * S^3 A^2 * H`** (where `H` is approximately `1/(1-gamma)`).
    *   Crucially, this bound for Policy Iteration **does not explicitly depend on the precision `delta`**. The speaker emphasizes that this is why "for really really high accuracy policy iteration definitely wins" because its bound "is not unbounded with log(1/epsilon)". Policy Iteration "kind of like bump into that it's like a magnet" to find the optimal policy.
    *   This lack of `delta` dependence for finding the *optimal* policy through Policy Iteration is the core reason why the speaker asserts that the **general lower bound for computational complexity for finding an optimal policy "turns out to be no" data dependence**.

In summary, the `S^2 A` term you mentioned is part of the Value Iteration runtime, which *does* require `delta` for precision. Policy Iteration, on the other hand, finds the *exact* optimal policy (making `delta` irrelevant for its final convergence) but has a different, typically higher, polynomial runtime complexity in terms of S and A. The distinction is critical: Value Iteration is for \(\delta\)-optimality with `log(1/delta)` dependence, while Policy Iteration is for *exact* optimality without `delta` dependence on the number of iterations to converge to that exact optimal policy.


The instructor's intuition regarding matrix multiplication is primarily used as an analogy to discuss the complexities and open problems in determining the precise computational bounds for algorithms, particularly in the context of solving MDPs. Here are the key points of their intuition:

*   **Initial Cubic Upper Bound**: The common, straightforward understanding is that multiplying two square matrices (say, of dimension \(N \times N\)) takes **cubic time**, i.e., \(N^3\) operations. This is considered an upper bound.
*   **Actual Exponent is Unknown**: Despite this common understanding, the instructor emphasizes that **we don't actually know the actual exponent** for matrix multiplication in the worst case. This highlights that it's a famously difficult and unresolved problem in computer science.
*   **Sub-Cubic Algorithms Exist**: The instructor acknowledges that algorithms exist that can reduce the exponent below three, mentioning "like 2.3 or something". These improvements are achieved through "blocking and a very clever techniques" or "problem decomposition and recycling designs". The instructor cites Gauss's work with complex numbers as an early example of such clever rearrangement of operations.
*   **Trivial Lower Bound**: There is a trivial lower bound for matrix multiplication, which is **\(N^2\)** (or \(d^2\) for dimension \(d\)). This is because you "have to write down the result", and an \(N \times N\) matrix has \(N^2\) entries.
*   **Analogy to MDP Complexity**: The instructor draws a parallel between the difficulty of finding the exact exponent for matrix multiplication and the challenge of establishing precise, tight lower bounds for MDP algorithms. They suggest that similar ideas, like representing probability tables in different ways, could potentially speed up calculations in MDPs, just as clever techniques reduce the exponent in matrix multiplication.


The value function space, in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with S states, is represented as **\(R^S\)**. This means that each possible value function is a point in an S-dimensional space.

Here's a breakdown of its structure:

*   **Convex Set**: The set of all possible value functions for all policies (the "value function polytope") is **convex**. This was a relatively recent discovery, proven in a paper by Dabashi and Dale, among others.
*   **Bounding Rectangle and Optimal/Minimal Values**: If you consider the "minimum enclosing rectangle" of this convex set in the high-dimensional space, its **upper-right corner** corresponds to the **optimal value function (\(V^*\))**, and its **lower-left corner** (representing minimized values, perhaps for costs) also **belongs to this set**.
*   **Extreme Points**: All the **corners or extreme points of this value function space correspond to deterministic memoryless policies**.
*   **Geometric Visualization**: The space "kind of looks like this", implying a shape where any points along lines connecting internal points are also within the set due to convexity. The optimal value function, \(V^*\), is located at the "upper-right corner" of this space.
*   **Continuity and Sensitivity**: A key theorem (often described as a continuity or sensitivity result) states that if you pick any value function `v` (which may or may not be within this exact polytope) and then derive a greedy policy `pi` from it, the value function of that policy, \(V_\pi\), will be "almost optimal". Geometrically, \(V_\pi\) is located within a "box of equal sizes" (a hypercube) grown from `v` towards \(V^*\). As the initial `v` gets closer to \(V^*\), the resulting \(V_\pi\) also converges to \(V^*\).
*   **Value Iteration Trajectory**: When applying Value Iteration, you start at an initial value function (e.g., the zero vector) and iteratively apply the Bellman optimality operator `T`. This process involves moving points in this \(R^S\) space, and these points **geometrically converge** towards \(V^*\). \(V^*\) is the unique **fixed point and attractive point** in this space under the `T` operator. The convergence is guaranteed to make progress; there are "no flatness" or "flat barriers" that would slow down the approach to \(V^*\).
*   **Role of Max Norm**: The use of the **maximum norm (infinity norm)** in analyzing these operations is crucial because the Bellman operator `T` (which involves maximization, adding rewards, and applying a linear operator for discounted future values) happens to be a **non-expansion or contraction in this specific norm**, ensuring the convergence properties work out.


**Precision for Near-Optimality** refers to the acceptable level of sub-optimality or inaccuracy when solving a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find a policy or its value function. This precision is often quantified by a small positive number, commonly denoted as **`epsilon`** or **`data`** in the provided sources.

Here's how precision for near-optimality is understood and applied in the context of MDPs:

*   **Definition and Goal**:
    *   The goal is to find a policy whose value function is **within a certain `epsilon` distance from the true optimal value function (\(V^*\))** in the maximum norm (infinity norm). This `epsilon` quantifies the desired precision, meaning how close to optimal the solution needs to be.
    *   The use of the maximum norm is crucial because the Bellman optimality operator (`T`) that drives Value Iteration is a non-expansion or contraction in this specific norm, ensuring robust convergence properties.

*   **Value Iteration and Precision Dependence**:
    *   **Value Iteration** is an algorithm that iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator `T` to a value function, causing it to **geometrically converge** towards the optimal value function \(V^*\). The error (distance from \(V^*\)) reduces by a factor of `gamma` in each iteration.
    *   To calculate an `epsilon`-optimal approximation of the optimal value function using Value Iteration, the **number of iterations (`k`) required explicitly depends on `epsilon`**. The iteration complexity is roughly proportional to `log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`.
    *   The overall computational complexity of Value Iteration to find a `data`-optimal policy is estimated as `S^2 * A / (1-gamma) * log(1/data)`. This formula clearly shows that **demanding higher precision (a smaller `data`) significantly increases the computational effort** due to the `log(1/data)` term.
    *   The term `1/(1-gamma)` is also a critical "blow-up factor" or "effective horizon" (`H`) that determines how fast geometric convergence is. When the discount factor `gamma` is very close to 1, this factor becomes very large, making convergence slower, even for a fixed `epsilon`.

*   **Policy Iteration and Independence from Precision (for Optimality)**:
    *   In contrast to Value Iteration, **Policy Iteration** is highlighted because it directly **"discovers a policy which is optimal"** without requiring an `epsilon` for its convergence to the *exact* optimal policy.
    *   The runtime bound for Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy is given as `S^4 * S^3 * A^2 * H` (where `H` is approximately `1/(1-gamma)`). Notably, this bound **does not explicitly depend on `delta`** (or `epsilon`).
    *   This distinction leads to the conclusion that "for really really high accuracy policy iteration definitely wins because this is unbounded" (referring to the `log(1/epsilon)` term in Value Iteration's complexity). Policy Iteration "kind of like bump into that it's like a magnet" to find the optimal policy.

*   **The "Continuity/Sensitivity Result" (Justification for Near-Optimality)**:
    *   A fundamental theorem supports the utility of aiming for near-optimality: if you take any value function `v` and derive a greedy policy `pi` with respect to it, the value function of that policy (`V_pi`) will be **"almost optimal to the degree that the function that you picked differs from the optimal value function"**.
    *   Geometrically, this means if you start at a point `v` in the S-dimensional value function space (`R^S`) and grow a "box of equal sizes" from `v` towards \(V^*\), the resulting `V_pi` will lie within this box and within the convex set of all valid value functions.
    *   This theorem ensures that achieving an `epsilon`-optimal approximation of the value function (\(V_k\) being `epsilon`-close to \(V^*\)) is a **"reasonable goal"** because the loss incurred by not having the truly optimal policy is limited by a policy error bound derived from this result. As the initial `v` gets closer to \(V^*\), the resulting `V_pi` also converges to \(V^*\).



Based on the sources and our conversation, your phrasing, "whether the delta (the precision on near-optimality) is required if we would just like to incur state squared times actions in terms of iteration," is **not entirely correct**, as the instructor directly states, "I wouldn't phrase it like that".

Here's a breakdown of why, distinguishing between Value Iteration (VI) and Policy Iteration (PI):

1.  **Value Iteration (VI) and Delta Dependence:**
    *   **Value Iteration aims to calculate an `epsilon`-optimal (or `data`-optimal) approximation of the optimal value function (\(V^*\))**. The `epsilon` or `data` here explicitly quantifies the desired precision.
    *   The **number of iterations (`k`) required for Value Iteration is directly dependent on this precision `data` (or `epsilon`)**. Specifically, `k` is proportional to `log(1/data) / (1-gamma)`. This means a smaller `data` (higher precision) requires more iterations.
    *   The **overall computational complexity for Value Iteration** to find a `data`-optimal policy is estimated as **`S^2 * A / (1-gamma) * log(1/data)`**. The `S^2 * A` component represents the cost per iteration (performing computations across all states and actions), but the crucial `log(1/data)` factor remains, showing that **`delta` (precision) is absolutely required** and influences the total iteration count for Value Iteration.

2.  **Policy Iteration (PI) and Independence from Delta (for Exact Optimality):**
    *   In contrast, **Policy Iteration is designed to "discover a policy which is optimal" directly**, meaning it aims for the exact optimal policy, not just an approximation.
    *   The **runtime bound for Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy does not explicitly depend on `delta`**. This is a key difference from Value Iteration.
    *   The estimated number of operations for Policy Iteration is `S^4 * S^3 * A^2 * H` (where `H` is approximately `1/(1-gamma)`). While this is a much higher polynomial complexity in S and A compared to the per-iteration cost of VI, the absence of a `log(1/data)` term means that **for "really really high accuracy," Policy Iteration "definitely wins"** because Value Iteration's `log(1/epsilon)` term becomes "unbounded".
    *   The instructor notes that the fundamental **lower bound for computing an optimal policy "turns out to be no" data dependence**. This is because Policy Iteration demonstrates that it's possible to converge to the exact optimal policy without that dependence.

In essence, while `S^2 * A` describes the operations *per iteration* for Value Iteration, the *total number of iterations* (and thus the total cost) for Value Iteration **does depend on `delta`** because it's seeking a `delta`-optimal solution. Policy Iteration, on the other hand, finds the *exact* optimal solution, and its convergence to that exact solution does not depend on a `delta` for precision, though its overall complexity in `S` and `A` is typically higher.



Yes, the **value function space is convex**.

Here's a breakdown of its structure regarding convexity:

*   The value function space, for an MDP with S states, is represented as \(\mathbf{R^S}\). Each possible value function is a point in this S-dimensional space.
*   The set of all possible value functions for all policies (sometimes referred to as the "value function polytope") is **convex**. This was highlighted as a "beautiful" and "neat result," which was not part of the standard lectures but was proven in a paper involving Dabashi and Dale within the last couple of years.
*   Within this convex set, if you consider the "minimum enclosing rectangle" in the high-dimensional space, its **upper-right corner corresponds to the optimal value function (\(V^*\))**, and its **lower-left corner** (representing minimized values, such as for costs) also **belongs to this set**. \(V^*\) is specifically defined as this upper-right corner.
*   All the **corners or extreme points of this value function space correspond to deterministic memoryless policies**.
*   The instructor emphasizes that this convexity is an important characteristic to keep in mind when visualizing or thinking about how optimal policies are found within this space. When applying Value Iteration, the process involves moving points within this \(R^S\) space, and these points geometrically converge towards \(V^*\), which is the unique fixed and attractive point under the Bellman optimality operator. The convergence is guaranteed to make progress, with "no flatness" or "flat barriers" that would slow down the approach to \(V^*\).



Policy Iteration's key insight lies in its ability to **directly discover an exactly optimal policy**, unlike Value Iteration which typically converges to a near-optimal approximation.

Here's a breakdown of this key insight:

*   **Direct Path to Optimality**: Policy Iteration works by iteratively improving a policy: you start with an initial policy, evaluate its value function (Policy Evaluation), and then derive a new, improved policy by acting greedily with respect to that value function (Policy Improvement). This process iterates, and it is guaranteed to discover a policy that is **optimal**.
*   **Independence from Precision (\(\delta\))**: A crucial aspect of Policy Iteration's insight is that its convergence to the *exact* optimal policy does not depend on a predefined precision parameter (`delta` or `epsilon`), which is a stark contrast to Value Iteration. While the computational effort for Value Iteration to find a `delta`-optimal policy scales with `log(1/delta)` (meaning higher precision demands significantly more iterations), Policy Iteration's runtime bound does not have this `delta` dependence.
*   **Superiority for High Accuracy**: Because of this independence from the precision parameter, Policy Iteration "definitely wins" for "really really high accuracy" requirements, as Value Iteration's `log(1/epsilon)` term would otherwise become "unbounded". Policy Iteration "kind of like bump into that it's like a magnet" to find the optimal policy.
*   **Guaranteed Convergence**: The process of Policy Iteration is guaranteed to improve the policy's value at a geometric rate. It involves jumping between the space of policies and the space of value functions, always moving towards optimality.
*   **Systematic Tie Resolution**: To ensure convergence and avoid "jittering," any ties that arise when choosing between actions during the greedy policy improvement step must be resolved in a systematic and consistent manner.

In essence, the key insight is that it's possible to design an iterative algorithm that guarantees reaching the true optimal policy in a finite number of steps (whose bound is independent of accuracy), providing a fundamental alternative to value-function approximation methods that rely on achieving a certain `epsilon` level of sub-optimality.


The discount factor, `gamma` (\(\gamma\)), significantly affects the computational bounds for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly for Value Iteration (VI) and, to some extent, Policy Iteration (PI).

Here's how `gamma` affects these bounds:

*   **Impact on Value Iteration (VI) Convergence and Complexity:**
    *   **Geometric Convergence Rate:** In Value Iteration, the distance between the current value function approximation (\(V_k\)) and the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) decreases by a factor of `gamma` in each iteration when measured in the maximum norm. This means the error reduces as \(V_k\) geometrically converges to \(V^*\).
    *   **Iteration Complexity:** To achieve an `epsilon`-optimal approximation of the optimal value function, the number of iterations (`k`) required by Value Iteration is approximately `log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`. The `log(1/gamma)` in the denominator is often replaced by `(1-gamma)` because the difference between the two becomes negligible as `gamma` approaches 1.
    *   **Total Computational Complexity:** The overall computational complexity for Value Iteration to find a `data`-optimal policy is estimated as `S^2 * A / (1-gamma) * log(1/data)`. This formula clearly shows the direct dependence on `gamma`.
    *   **The "Blow-Up Factor" `1/(1-gamma)`:** This term is a critical "blow-up factor" that dictates how slow convergence can be. As `gamma` approaches 1 (e.g., `1 - 10^-5`), this factor becomes very large (e.g., `10^5`). This makes the geometric convergence, while technically fast for a fixed `gamma`, practically very slow when `gamma` is close to 1. It's also referred to as a "characteristic time" or "effective horizon". The instructor emphasizes that this factor is "real in a worst-case fashion".
    *   **Relevance to Average Reward Setting:** The case where `gamma` approaches 1 is particularly relevant because it models the average reward setting, also known as the "vanishing discount approach".

*   **Impact on Policy Iteration (PI) Complexity:**
    *   While Policy Iteration directly discovers an *exactly optimal policy* without depending on a precision parameter (`delta`), its overall computational complexity *still depends on `gamma`* indirectly.
    *   The estimated number of operations for Policy Iteration to find an optimal policy is given as `S^4 * S^3 * A^2 * H`. Here, `H` represents the "effective horizon," which is approximately `1/(1-gamma)`.
    *   Therefore, even though Policy Iteration doesn't have the `log(1/data)` dependency of Value Iteration, the `1/(1-gamma)` factor (or `H`) still contributes to its complexity when `gamma` is very close to 1.

In summary, `gamma`'s proximity to 1 significantly increases the computational effort required for both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, primarily through the `1/(1-gamma)` factor, which acts as a "blow-up factor" or "effective horizon".




Value Iteration's (VI) key insight lies in its **iterative approach to approximate the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator (\(T\))**. This method is distinguished by its convergence properties and its efficiency for finding near-optimal solutions.

Here's a breakdown of Value Iteration's key insights:

*   **Geometric Convergence to an Approximation**: Value Iteration generates a sequence of value functions (\(V_k\)) that **geometrically converge to \(V^*\)**. This means that the distance between the current value function approximation (\(V_k\)) and the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) decreases by a factor of `gamma` in each iteration when measured in the maximum norm. This rapid convergence is due to \(V^*\) being the **unique fixed and attractive point** of the Bellman optimality operator, ensuring continuous progress towards optimality without "flat barriers" that would slow convergence.
*   **Controllable Precision for Near-Optimality**: A core aspect of VI is its ability to calculate an **`epsilon`-optimal (or `data`-optimal) approximation of the optimal value function**. The number of iterations (`k`) required to reach a specific `epsilon` distance from \(V^*\) is directly dependent on the desired precision and the discount factor `gamma`. Specifically, `k` is approximately `log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`. This explicit dependence means that for higher precision (smaller `epsilon`), more iterations are required, as reflected in the total computational complexity of `S^2 * A / (1-gamma) * log(1/data)`.
*   **Computational Efficiency for Practical Solutions**: While the total complexity for Value Iteration includes a term dependent on precision, its **computations per iteration (`S^2 * A`) are considered "cheap"**. This makes Value Iteration particularly advantageous for scenarios where **a near-optimal policy is sufficient**. The instructor notes that for "low accuracies," Value Iteration "could win" compared to Policy Iteration, even though Policy Iteration "definitely wins" for "really really high accuracy" because Value Iteration's `log(1/epsilon)` term becomes "unbounded" as `epsilon` approaches zero. This highlights VI's practical strength in efficiently finding good, though not necessarily exact, solutions.



Value Iteration (VI) converges by iteratively applying the **Bellman optimality operator (\(T\))** to a sequence of value functions, gradually refining the approximation until it reaches the optimal value function (\(V^*\)).

Here's a detailed explanation of how Value Iteration converges:

*   **Iterative Application of the Bellman Optimality Operator**: Value Iteration starts with an initial value function, say \(V_0\) (often the zero vector, but any function works), and then iteratively applies the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to generate successive approximations: \(V_{k+1} = T(V_k)\). The Bellman optimality operator \(T\) for a value function \(V\) is defined as \(T(V) = \max_a [R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V(s')]\). This operation involves a maximization over actions, immediate rewards, and discounted future values based on the current value function estimate.

*   **\(V^*\) as the Unique Fixed and Attractive Point**: The optimal value function \(V^*\) is the **unique fixed point** of the Bellman optimality operator \(T\). This means that when \(V^*\) is plugged into the operator, it returns itself: \(V^* = T(V^*)\). Furthermore, \(V^*\) is an **attractive point**. This implies that regardless of the initial starting point in the value function space, the sequence of value functions generated by Value Iteration will eventually converge towards \(V^*\). You can imagine a "vector field" in the value function space where all paths lead to \(V^*\).

*   **Geometric Convergence due to Contraction Mapping**: The operator \(T\) is a **contraction mapping**. This is a crucial property for convergence. When measured in the maximum norm (infinity norm), the distance between the current value function approximation (\(V_k\)) and the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) **decreases by a factor of \(\gamma\) (the discount factor) in each iteration**. This property means the error is reduced geometrically. The maximum norm is particularly suitable because the maximization operation within the \(T\) operator is a non-expansion in this norm, allowing the overall operator to be a contraction.

*   **Guaranteed Progress and No "Flat Barriers"**: Due to the contraction property, Value Iteration is guaranteed to make continuous **progress towards \(V^*\)**. There are "no flatness" or "flat barriers" that would slow down the approach to \(V^*\). This ensures that the algorithm will not get stuck or plateau before reaching the optimal value function.

*   **Convergence to an `epsilon`-Optimal Approximation**: Value Iteration is designed to calculate an `epsilon`-optimal (or `data`-optimal) approximation of the optimal value function. The number of iterations (\(k\)) required to reach a specific `epsilon` distance from \(V^*\) is approximately `log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`. This shows that as the desired precision increases (smaller `epsilon`), more iterations are needed.



Both Value Iteration (VI) and Policy Iteration (PI) are fundamental algorithms in reinforcement learning designed to find an **optimal policy** for a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). An optimal policy, in turn, dictates the sequence of actions that an agent should take in each state to maximize its expected long-term discounted reward, thereby defining what could be considered an **optimal trajectory** through the MDP.

Here's how they relate to finding an optimal policy and, by extension, an optimal trajectory:

*   **Goal: Finding the Optimal Value Function or Optimal Policy**
    *   The ultimate goal is to discover an **optimal policy** (\(\pi^*\)) that, for every state, selects the action that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards. This policy then guides the agent to follow an "optimal trajectory" from any starting state.
    *   The optimal policy is intimately linked to the **optimal value function** (\(V^*\)), which represents the maximum possible discounted sum of rewards achievable from each state.

*   **Value Iteration's Approach to Optimality (and Trajectories):**
    *   **Iterative Approximation of \(V^*\)**: Value Iteration begins with an initial value function (e.g., the zero vector) and iteratively applies the **Bellman optimality operator (\(T\))** to generate a sequence of increasingly refined value function approximations (\(V_k\)). This process involves for each state, considering all possible actions and calculating the maximum one-step look-ahead value based on the current value function estimate.
    *   **Geometric Convergence**: This sequence of value functions geometrically converges to \(V^*\) because \(V^*\) is the **unique fixed and attractive point** of the Bellman optimality operator. The error (distance from \(V^*\)) decreases by a factor of `gamma` in each iteration when measured in the maximum norm.
    *   **Deriving a Policy**: Once \(V^*\) has been approximated sufficiently (i.e., to an `epsilon`-optimal level), an `epsilon`-optimal policy can be derived by performing a **greedy one-step look-ahead** with respect to the final approximated value function. This greedy policy will then guide the agent along a near-optimal trajectory.
    *   **Controllable Precision**: VI is particularly effective for calculating an `epsilon`-optimal approximation of \(V^*\). The number of iterations required depends on the desired precision (`epsilon`) and the discount factor `gamma`. For "low accuracies" (where a near-optimal policy is sufficient), Value Iteration "could win" due to its "cheap" computations per iteration.

*   **Policy Iteration's Approach to Optimality (and Trajectories):**
    *   **Direct Discovery of Optimal Policy**: Policy Iteration works by alternating between two phases:
        1.  **Policy Evaluation**: For a given policy, calculate its exact value function (\(V^\pi\)).
        2.  **Policy Improvement**: Derive a new, improved policy by acting **greedily** with respect to the value function just calculated. A greedy policy maximizes the one-step look-ahead value based on the current value function, choosing the action that yields the highest immediate reward plus discounted future value.
    *   **Guaranteed Exact Optimality**: This iterative process is guaranteed to discover an **exactly optimal policy**. This means it "bumps into" the optimal policy "like a magnet". Unlike Value Iteration, Policy Iteration's convergence to the exact optimal policy does not depend on a predefined precision parameter (`delta` or `epsilon`).
    *   **Systematic Tie Resolution**: To ensure convergence and prevent "jittering," any ties that arise when choosing between actions during the greedy policy improvement step must be resolved in a **systematic and consistent manner**.
    *   **Superiority for High Accuracy**: For "really really high accuracy" requirements (i.e., seeking the truly optimal policy), Policy Iteration "definitely wins" because Value Iteration's `log(1/epsilon)` term for precision "becomes unbounded" as `epsilon` approaches zero.

*   **Relationship and Performance Comparison:**
    *   Both VI and PI are iterative methods that move towards optimal solutions.
    *   Policy Iteration "cannot be slower than Value Iteration".
    *   The total computational complexity for both algorithms is significantly affected by the **discount factor `gamma`**. As `gamma` approaches 1 (modeling long horizons or average reward settings), a "blow-up factor" of `1/(1-gamma)` appears in their complexity bounds, making calculations more expensive. This `1/(1-gamma)` term is sometimes referred to as the "effective horizon".
    *   While Value Iteration iterates through value functions to approximate the optimal value function, Policy Iteration explicitly iterates between policies and their value functions to find the optimal policy directly.
    *   In essence, both algorithms provide a means to compute the optimal policy that an agent should follow. This optimal policy, when executed, will trace out an optimal path or "trajectory" through the MDP over time.




Policy Iteration (PI) converges by an iterative process that **alternates between evaluating a policy and then improving it**, ultimately leading to an optimal policy.

Here's how Policy Iteration converges:

*   **Alternating Phases**: Policy Iteration begins with an initial policy. It then iteratively performs two main steps:
    1.  **Policy Evaluation**: For a given policy, Policy Iteration **calculates its exact value function** (\(V^\pi\)). This involves determining the expected discounted sum of rewards for following that specific policy from each state.
    2.  **Policy Improvement (Greedy Policy)**: After evaluating the policy, a **new, improved policy is derived by acting greedily** with respect to the value function just calculated. A "greedy policy" means that for each state, you perform a one-step look-ahead, choosing the action that **maximizes the immediate reward plus the discounted future value** from the next state, as estimated by the current value function.

*   **Guaranteed Improvement and Exact Optimality**: This iterative process is **guaranteed to improve the policy** at each step, moving towards optimality at a **geometric rate**. Policy Iteration is notable because it is guaranteed to discover an **exactly optimal policy**. It "bumps into" the optimal policy "like a magnet," meaning it will definitively reach it without requiring an `epsilon` (precision) parameter like Value Iteration does.

*   **Systematic Tie Resolution**: A critical aspect for Policy Iteration's convergence is how it handles ties during the greedy policy improvement step. If multiple actions yield the same maximum value, the algorithm **must resolve these ties in a systematic and consistent manner**. This means if an action was chosen previously due to a tie, it should be kept if it still maximizes the value. Failing to do so can lead to "jittering" where the policy switches back and forth, preventing proper convergence.

*   **Comparison to Value Iteration**: While Value Iteration approximates the optimal value function, Policy Iteration directly searches for the optimal policy. Policy Iteration "cannot be slower than Value Iteration". For scenarios demanding "really really high accuracy," Policy Iteration "definitely wins" because Value Iteration's computational complexity includes a `log(1/data)` term that "becomes unbounded" as the required precision approaches exact optimality.


The sources confirm that if you represent the probability tables that correspond to transition probabilities in different ways, you **can speed up calculations** in MDPs.

However, the provided source does not go into detail about *how* or *why* these different representations lead to speed improvements. It briefly mentions that this area "becomes very very particular" and is related to reducing exponents in upper bounds and matching with lower bounds, which is considered a "cruel requirement". The discussion suggests that while it's an interesting topic, it's also highly specialized and complex, potentially depending on how the input is represented.


The concept of "reducing exponents in upper bounds" being "fine" relates to the ongoing challenge and progression in understanding the computational complexity of algorithms, particularly in the context of MDPs and matrix multiplication.

Here's an explanation based on the sources:

*   **Improving Upper Bounds as an "Adversarial Enterprise"**: Reducing the exponent in an upper bound means finding a more efficient algorithm or a tighter theoretical limit on an algorithm's worst-case performance. For example, if an algorithm was previously thought to take \(N^3\) time, and new research shows it can be done in \(N^{2.3}\) time, the exponent has been reduced. This pursuit is described as an "**adversarial enterprise**". It represents continuous progress in making computations more efficient.

*   **Difficulty of Matching Lower Bounds**: The reason reducing upper bounds is considered "fine" is implicitly contrasted with the much more **challenging and "cruel requirement" of matching these improved upper bounds with lower bounds**. A lower bound establishes a theoretical minimum amount of computation required for *any* algorithm to solve a problem. While we have known algorithms (upper bounds) with exponents like 2.3 for matrix multiplication, the fundamental lower bound is still \(D^2\) (because you have to write down the result). Proving that an algorithm *cannot* perform better than a certain exponent is significantly harder and depends on "so many things".

*   **Practical vs. Theoretical Optimality**: For practical purposes, identifying and reducing upper bounds directly translates to designing potentially faster algorithms. Even without a matching lower bound, an improved upper bound indicates a better algorithmic approach. It helps in understanding what *is* achievable, even if the absolute theoretical limit (the tightest lower bound) is still unknown. The speaker suggests that working out problems like how long matrix multiplication takes is a prerequisite to fully answering more complex questions about MDP complexity, as these problems involve similar challenges in proving tight bounds.

In essence, while the ultimate goal in complexity theory might be to find matching upper and lower bounds, reducing upper bounds is a valuable and "fine" step because it demonstrates progress in efficiency and is a more tractable problem than proving fundamental lower limits that match the current best upper bounds.


In the context of the provided sources, particularly when discussing the **computational complexity** of algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, computation is defined through different models.

The primary model used for analyzing the complexity of these algorithms involves **counting elementary arithmetic and logic operations**. In this model:
*   **Maximizing two numbers counts as one operation**.
*   **Adding two numbers counts as one operation**.
*   **Multiplying two numbers counts as one operation**.
This is described as the "computation model that you learn about in school".

However, the sources also introduce an alternative perspective on computation, known as the **binary computation model** (or the Turing machine model). In this model:
*   **The size of the input, in terms of how many bits it has, is what truly matters** for computation.
*   This is because a Turing machine processes data bit by bit; it needs to read all probability tables, which are stored as zeros or ones in individual cells.

The choice of computation model can have consequences, as it dictates how an algorithm's "runtime" or "effort" is measured. For instance, the discussion highlights that representing probability tables in different ways might speed up calculations, although this "becomes very very particular" and relates to reducing exponents in upper bounds of complexity. This implies that the specific model of computation and how data is structured within it directly influence the efficiency of algorithms.



When discussing computation, particularly in the context of analyzing the complexity of algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, the sources highlight two primary models of computation:

*   **Counting Elementary Arithmetic and Logic Operations**:
    *   This is described as the "computation model that you learn about in school".
    *   In this model, **elementary operations are counted as single units of computation**. For example:
        *   Maximizing two numbers counts as one operation.
        *   Adding two numbers counts as one operation.
        *   Multiplying two numbers counts as one operation.

*   **Binary Computation Model (Turing Machine Model)**:
    *   This model considers that **the size of the input, in terms of how many bits it has, is what truly matters** for computation.
    *   This perspective arises because a Turing machine processes data bit by bit; it needs to read all probability tables, which are stored as zeros or ones in individual cells.

The choice of computation model is significant because it dictates how an algorithm's "runtime" or "effort" is measured. The sources suggest that representing probability tables (which correspond to transition probabilities) in different ways can potentially speed up calculations, although this becomes "very very particular" and relates to "reducing exponents in upper bounds". This implies that the specific model of computation, and how data is structured within it, directly influences the efficiency of algorithms.

The sources discuss the argument for a lower bound on computation in the context of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which applies to algorithms like Policy Iteration. This argument primarily hinges on the fundamental necessity of processing the input data and the specific characteristics of Policy Iteration in finding an *optimal* policy.

Here's an overview of the argument for the lower bound:

1.  **Algorithm-Independent Requirement**: The argument for the lower bound is **algorithm-independent**. It's not specific to Policy Iteration but rather applies to *any* algorithm that aims to solve an MDP.
2.  **Necessity of Reading Input**: Fundamentally, any algorithm must **read all the numbers** that define the MDP. This implies that an algorithm "cannot avoid of reading all these numbers".
3.  **Touching State-Action Pairs**: This translates to the requirement that an algorithm "has to touch basically **every state action pair** S times before you get an answer". This means the computational effort will at least scale with the number of states (\(S\)) and actions (\(A\)).
4.  **No Dependence on Accuracy (\(\delta\)) for Optimal Policy**: A crucial aspect highlighted is that for Policy Iteration, which is guaranteed to discover an **exactly optimal policy**, the lower bound for computation **does not need to include a dependence on the precision parameter (\(\delta\))**.
    *   This is in contrast to Value Iteration, which aims to find a \(\delta\)-optimal approximation to the optimal value function, and thus its iteration complexity includes a `log(1/delta)` term that "becomes unbounded" as the required precision approaches exact optimality.
    *   For Policy Iteration, "at one point as that [\(\delta\)] is really small you are demanding the optimal policy and this guy is going to find optimal policy". Policy Iteration "kind of like bump into that, it's like a magnet", meaning it converges directly to the optimal solution.
5.  **Model of Computation**: This lower bound is typically expressed in terms of **elementary arithmetic and logic operations**. This includes operations like maximizing two numbers, adding two numbers, or multiplying two numbers, each counting as a single operation.

While the sources discuss these aspects of the lower bound, they also emphasize that proving tight lower bounds that match the known upper bounds (like the \(S^4 A^2 H\) complexity for Policy Iteration) is a "cruel requirement" and an ongoing challenge in complexity theory. It's noted that the exact exponent for matrix multiplication, a related problem, is still unknown, which gives context to the difficulty of establishing precise lower bounds for MDP algorithms. The existing lower bound of "touching every state action pair" is a fundamental, and perhaps trivial, minimum requirement.


The argument for proving the lower bound of Policy Iteration, as discussed in the sources, hinges on fundamental computational necessities and the specific characteristic of Policy Iteration in finding an **exactly optimal policy**.

Here are the details for understanding the lower bound:

### 1. Fundamental Lower Bound (Algorithm-Independent)

The most basic lower bound applies to **any algorithm** aiming to solve an MDP, not just Policy Iteration.

*   **Necessity of Reading Input**: Any algorithm "cannot avoid of reading all these numbers" that define the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This means the algorithm must process all input data. This is also known as an "algorithm independent" argument.
*   **Touching State-Action Pairs**: This translates into the practical requirement that an algorithm "has to touch basically every state action pair S times before you get an answer". This implies a fundamental computational cost proportional to the number of states (\(S\)) and actions (\(A\)).
*   **Model of Computation**: This lower bound is typically expressed in terms of **counting elementary arithmetic and logic operations**. For instance, maximizing two numbers, adding two numbers, or multiplying two numbers each count as a single operation in this model. This is described as the "computation model that you learn about in school".

### 2. Specifics for Finding an Optimal Policy (Policy Iteration)

A critical aspect for Policy Iteration's lower bound is its ability to find an **exactly optimal policy**, which distinguishes it from algorithms like Value Iteration that aim for an approximation.

*   **No Dependence on Accuracy (\(\delta\))**: For algorithms that are guaranteed to discover an **exactly optimal policy**, such as Policy Iteration, the lower bound for computation **does not need to include a dependence on the precision parameter (\(\delta\))**. This is a key insight because Policy Iteration "kind of like bump into that, it's like a magnet" to the optimal policy, meaning it converges directly to the optimal solution without needing an \(\epsilon\) (precision) parameter to define its stopping condition for optimality.
*   **Contrast with Value Iteration**: This is a significant difference from Value Iteration. Value Iteration's iteration complexity includes a `log(1/epsilon)` term because it seeks an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation to the optimal value function. As the required precision approaches exact optimality (i.e., \(\epsilon\) goes to zero), this `log(1/epsilon)` term "becomes unbounded". Policy Iteration, therefore, "definitely wins" for scenarios demanding "really really high accuracy" because its computational effort doesn't "blow up" as precision increases.
*   **Systematic Tie Resolution**: For Policy Iteration to guarantee convergence to an optimal policy and avoid "jittering," it's crucial that "ties have to be resolved in a systematic manner" during the greedy policy improvement step. If multiple actions yield the same maximum value, the algorithm must consistently choose one, especially if it was chosen previously.

### 3. Challenges in Proving Tight Lower Bounds

While the fundamental requirement of reading the input provides a basic lower bound (proportional to \(S \times A\)), proving a **tight lower bound** that matches the known upper bounds for Policy Iteration (e.g., \(S^4 A^2 H\), where \(H = 1/(1-\gamma)\) is the effective horizon) is a complex challenge.

*   **"Cruel Requirement"**: The task of trying to match improved upper bounds with corresponding lower bounds is described as a "cruel requirement". It's a difficult problem that "depends on so many things".
*   **Analogy to Matrix Multiplication**: This difficulty is exemplified by the problem of matrix multiplication. While algorithms exist that reduce the upper bound (e.g., to \(D^{2.3}\) for \(D \times D\) matrices), the precise lower bound beyond the trivial \(D^2\) (which is simply the cost of writing down the result) is still unknown. The sources imply that establishing tight lower bounds for MDP algorithms faces similar complexities.
*   **Role of \(1/(1-\gamma)\)**: The term \(1/(1-\gamma)\), referred to as the "effective horizon", is a characteristic time of how long it takes to get an answer in the absence of extra structure. It is suggested that this factor is "real in a worst case fashion" for the upper bounds, and there is "some indication that this is real" in the average reward literature (which is related to the \(\gamma \to 1\) case). However, a "very clean presentation of this result for the discounted setting at all" regarding a precise lower bound involving \(1/(1-\gamma)\) is noted as "unfortunate" and an area that is "not a fully finished business". This indicates that while the basic input-reading lower bound is clear, a precisely matching, tight lower bound that incorporates factors like the discount rate is still an open research area.



You're asking for clarification on the relationships between the different `H` bounds in the "discounting section". Your confusion stems from how the conclusion \(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is reached, given that you understood \(H \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) and \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon} \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\).

The key insight from the sources is that the relationship \(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is **not derived** from the other two inequalities, but rather it is a **stronger requirement that is intentionally imposed**.

Here's a breakdown of the argument:

*   **Understanding the Bounds**:
    *   \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is the **minimum number of iterations** actually needed to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal approximation to the optimal value function.
    *   \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is an **upper bound** on \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\), meaning \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon} \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\).

*   **The "Stronger Requirement"**:
    *   Instead of simply requiring \(H \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) (which would be sufficient for correctness), the discussion **demands a stronger requirement**: **\(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\)**.
    *   The rationale is that if you satisfy this stronger requirement (\(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\)), then because \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is already greater than or equal to \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\), it logically follows that \(H\) will also be greater than or equal to \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) (\(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon} \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\)). This ensures that "nice things happen" in terms of guaranteeing sufficient iterations.

*   **Why This Stronger Requirement is Used**:
    *   **Simplicity and Ease**: The primary reason for using \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) as the required number of iterations is to **simplify the calculations and make the bounds easier to state and remember**. As mentioned, it means "every time you would not need to write this log one over gamma you just write one minus gamma".
    *   **Negligible Price**: The "price that we pay for it is negligible". This means that the difference between \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) and \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is very small, especially as the discount factor \(\gamma\) approaches one.
        *   Both \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) and \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) are roughly of the size of \(1/(1-\gamma)\).
        *   While \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is a "slightly bigger guy" than \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\), the difference between the two, when renormalized by multiplying with \((1-\gamma)\), goes to zero as \(\gamma\) approaches one. In essence, "relative to the size of the interval, the difference between the two is vanishing".

In summary, the statement \(H \ge H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) is a **design choice for simplicity and convenience**, not a deduction. It's a stronger condition that, by its nature, inherently satisfies the minimal requirement \(H \ge H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) without significant practical cost due to the asymptotic closeness of \(H_{\gamma, \epsilon}\) and \(H^*_{\gamma, \epsilon}\).


The identity \(v^{\pi'} - v^{\pi} = (I - \gamma P_{\pi'})^{-1} [r_{\pi'} - (I - \gamma P_{\pi'})v^{\pi}] = (I - \gamma P_{\pi'})^{-1} [T_{\pi'} v^{\pi} - v^{\pi}]\) is described as a **fundamental and highly important concept** in the context of planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

Here's a breakdown of its importance:

*   **Foundational Derivation**: This identity, referred to as the "value difference decomposition or identity," is derived directly by "taking the definitions literally of the value functions" and can be obtained "with two lines of october". This indicates its fundamental nature in the mathematical framework of MDPs.

*   **Widespread Utility**: The sources emphasize that this identity is "very useful and and it's the basis for many different things". It's expected to be used "everywhere in the course a lot of cases". This suggests its broad applicability across various theoretical analyses and algorithms for MDPs.

*   **Understanding Policy Improvement**: While the sources do not explicitly detail a proof using this identity within the provided text, its form directly quantifies the difference between the value functions of two policies, \(v^{\pi'}\) and \(v^{\pi}\). In Policy Iteration, the core idea is to iteratively improve a policy by evaluating its value function and then performing a greedy step to find a new, potentially better, policy. This identity provides the mathematical tool to:
    *   **Quantify Improvement**: The term \([T_{\pi'} v^{\pi} - v^{\pi}]\) measures how much the value of policy \(\pi'\) would improve over the current value function \(v^{\pi}\) if \(\pi'\) were applied, specifically indicating the difference between the Bellman backup for \(\pi'\) applied to \(v^{\pi}\) and \(v^{\pi}\) itself. A positive difference here implies potential for improvement.
    *   **Relate to Greedification**: The first result discussed in the sources states that if you take a greedy policy with respect to some value function \(v\), the value function of that new policy (\(v^{\pi'}\)) will be "almost optimal to the degree that the function that you picked differs from the optimal value function". This identity formalizes how such a greedy step (which defines \(\pi'\)) leads to an actual improvement in value, leading closer to \(v^*\).

*   **Adaptability to Action Value Functions**: The identity is versatile, as the sources note that "a lot of cases we're going to replace the the state value functions with action value functions then you can buy the same thing". This indicates its usefulness not just for state-value functions (\(V\)), but also for action-value functions (\(Q\)), which are often central to reinforcement learning algorithms.

In essence, this identity is **critical for rigorously analyzing and proving the convergence and performance guarantees of planning algorithms like Policy Iteration**. It provides a precise way to measure and understand the progress made from one policy to another, which is at the heart of finding an optimal policy in MDPs.
