II. Quiz Answer Key
The primary focus of CMPE 653 is to teach students how theoreticians think about reinforcement learning (RL) and related problems. The instructor aims to share their perspective on problem-solving in RL, including notable results, open questions, and the tools and techniques used to answer them.
The teaching assistants for CMPE 653 are Alex and Shivam. Their primary role is to assist the instructor in running the class smoothly, particularly by monitoring the chat and answering student questions during the live lectures.
The instructor prefers to teach in an interactive fashion, encouraging students to turn on their video for feedback. They will frequently ask questions to gauge understanding and use the chat for student responses, with TAs interjecting for important discussions.
The grading breakdown for CMPE 653 is as follows: four homework assignments, each worth 10% (total 40%); a take-home midterm worth 20%; and a project worth 40% of the final mark.
Homework Zero serves as a self-assessment to give students a chance to gauge the typical difficulty of problems in the course. Students must achieve a certain percentage (e.g., 85% out of 150) to pass, and failure requires a discussion with the instructor to remain in the class.
"Planning" is a computational question about efficiently computing actions for a good policy, without interaction with the environment. "Batch learning" involves learning a good policy from a pre-collected batch of data, similar to supervised learning. "Online learning" is classic reinforcement learning, where there is continuous interaction with an unknown environment to collect as much reward as possible.
MDP stands for Markov Decision Process (or Problem). Its four fundamental primitives are: states, actions, stochastic transitions between states (given an action), and rewards. There is also an objective function.
A discount factor (gamma) is introduced in the objective function to ensure that the infinite sum of rewards is well-defined and convergent. It also implies that future rewards matter less, providing a form of regularization and defining an "effective horizon" for the problem.
A policy generally defines a way of choosing actions, possibly randomly, based on the entire history of the process up to the current state (past states and actions). It maps histories to probability distributions over actions.
The instructor assumes finite state and action sets to simplify the mathematical framework and avoid complex measure theory. The key takeaway is that most results extend to continuous cases under certain "regularity assumptions," and that dealing with "big finite" sets often captures the computational challenges of continuous settings.

IV. Glossary of Key Terms
Action Set: A collection of all possible actions an agent can take in a given state.
Agent: The decision-making entity that interacts with the environment (MDP) by taking actions.
Batch Learning: A reinforcement learning paradigm where an agent learns a policy from a pre-collected, static dataset (batch of data) without further interaction with the environment. It is analogous to supervised learning.
Discount Factor (Gamma, γ): A value between 0 and 1 (exclusive) used to weigh future rewards. Rewards received further in the future are discounted, meaning they contribute less to the total return, ensuring the infinite sum of rewards converges.
Effective Horizon: The approximate number of steps in the future beyond which rewards have a negligible impact on the total discounted return. It is related to the discount factor (e.g., ~1 / (1 - γ)).
History (of a process): The sequence of past states and actions up to a given point in time (s0, a0, s1, a1, ..., st-1, at-1, st).
Markov Decision Process (MDP): A mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making in stochastic environments. It consists of states, actions, stochastic transitions, and rewards.

A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is defined as a **mathematical model used to represent an environment where stochastic transitions between states occur, controlled by an agent**. It is the core concept at the heart of the three main blocks of the class: planning, batch learning, and online learning.

An MDP is comprised of several key components:

*   **States (S)**: These are fundamental elements of the MDP. The lecture assumes the set of states (S) is **finite** to simplify the discussion and avoid complex measure theory, though many results can extend to continuous cases with additional assumptions. Even with finite states, the set can be "big finite," meaning it might not fit into a computer's memory, which still captures many practical challenges.
*   **Actions (A)**: Similar to states, actions are primitive elements. The set of actions (A) is also assumed to be **finite** for simplicity, though continuous actions are possible in theory.
*   **Stochastic Transitions**: If an agent is in a specific state (s) and takes a particular action (a), the environment transitions to a next state (s') according to a **probability distribution**. This distribution is often denoted as P_a(s, s') or P(s' | s, a).
*   **Rewards (R)**: For every state-action pair (s, a), there is a **deterministic reward**, which is a real number. These rewards are sometimes normalized, for example, to be within the or [-1, 1] interval to keep values "under control".
*   **Objective Function (Return)**: The goal in an MDP is to maximize the accumulation of rewards over time. This accumulated reward is called the **return**.
    *   **Infinite Sum**: The return is typically defined as an **infinite sum of rewards** collected along a trajectory.
    *   **Discounting**: To ensure this infinite sum is well-defined and convergent, a **discount factor (gamma)** is introduced. Gamma is a number between 0 and 1. It implies that future rewards are less valuable than immediate rewards. The "effective horizon" of a discounted problem is approximately 1/(1 - gamma), meaning rewards beyond this point have a negligible impact on the total sum for a given accuracy. While other approaches like taking averages exist, discounting is often chosen for its relative simplicity and to avoid "nasty issues" associated with averages.
    *   **Expected Return**: Because transitions are stochastic, a trajectory and its return have a distribution. Therefore, the objective is to **maximize the expectation of the return**, rather than the return itself.

**Policy (π)**:
The way an agent chooses actions is governed by a **policy**.
*   A policy can be **randomized**, meaning it can choose actions probabilistically.
*   It can also utilize the **entire history** of the process (past states and actions) to decide on the next action.
*   A policy is formally a map that takes a history (sequence of past states and actions) at time `t` and returns a **probability distribution over possible actions** at that time. This is denoted as π_t(a | h_t), where `h_t` is the history.
*   **Observed State Assumption**: For foundational theory, it is often assumed that the **controller can observe the state of the system**. This assumption sets a high bar and allows for understanding the theoretical limits of what can be achieved, even if practically observing all states might be infeasible for very large state spaces. In such cases, methods like abstracting state information are used.
*   **Measurability**: For the probability measures defining trajectories to be well-defined, policies must satisfy certain "regularity assumptions," essentially being **probability kernels**. This means that for any given history, it assigns a probability measure to actions, and if you fix a subset of actions, the probability assigned to that subset must be a measurable function of the history.

**Interconnection and Value**:
*   The **interconnection** of a policy and the MDP's transition structure creates a **closed-loop system**, which induces a probability distribution over the space of all possible trajectories. This distribution is formed by multiplying the initial state probability (from an initial state distribution, μ), the policy's probabilities for actions given histories, and the MDP's transition probabilities for next states.
*   The **value of a policy** (V_π(μ)) for a given starting state distribution (μ) is defined as the **expected value of the return** under this induced distribution over trajectories.
*   It is often sufficient to study the value when starting from a **single specific state** (V_π(s)), as knowing the values for all single states can describe the value for any starting distribution.
*   The **optimal value** (V*(s)) for a given state `s` is the **supremum of the values across all possible policies** starting from that state.


A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a foundational concept in the study of reinforcement learning, sitting at the heart of planning, batch learning, and online learning. While we've discussed its core components, several nuanced insights from the sources enhance our understanding:

*   **The "Big Finite" Assumption for Simplicity and Scope:**
    *   The assumption of **finite sets of states (S) and actions (A)** is made primarily to **simplify the discussion and avoid the complexities of measure theory**. This makes probability distributions "totally trivial" as probability vectors, which is intuitive.
    *   Despite being finite, the state set can be "big finite," meaning it might not fit into a computer's memory. This "big finite" concept is crucial because, as the instructor notes, it **captures "most of your troubles" and practical challenges** encountered even in theoretically continuous environments. While extensions to continuous cases are possible, the finite assumption frees the mind from "measuratic weirdness".

*   **Specific Rationale for Discounting Rewards:**
    *   The **discount factor (gamma)**, a value between 0 and 1, is introduced to ensure the infinite sum of rewards (the return) is **well-defined and convergent**.
    *   A key nuance is the concept of an **"effective horizon," which is approximately 1/(1 - gamma)**. This means that rewards collected beyond this point in time have a negligible impact on the total sum, especially when considering a certain accuracy.
    *   The choice of discounting over alternative approaches like taking averages is deliberate: **averaging can lead to "nasty issues" where the averages might not be defined**, particularly with cyclic behaviors. Discounting is preferred for its "relative simplicity" and to avoid such complications.

*   **The "Observed State" Assumption as a High Bar:**
    *   The theory often assumes that the **controller (agent) can fully observe the state of the system**. This is acknowledged as a **"very high bar"** in practice.
    *   The primary justification for this assumption in foundational theory is to **understand the "theoretical limits" of what can be achieved**. It allows the establishment of an "upper bound" on how much reward can be collected and serves as a starting point for building intuition and basic theory. The class will later address scenarios where full state observation is impractical, requiring state abstraction.

*   **Policy Measurability and Probability Kernels:**
    *   For the probability measures defining trajectories to be well-defined, policies must satisfy certain "regularity assumptions" and be **"probability kernels"**.
    *   This means a policy maps histories to **probability distributions over actions**, and if you fix a subset of actions, the probability assigned to that subset must be a **measurable function of the history**. This property is crucial for composing probability measures and ensuring the proper definition of induced measures over trajectories. The source even references the **Ionoscope Tulaska theorem** as a tool that allows for the proper construction of this induced probability measure.

*   **The Purpose and Interplay of the Three Blocks (Planning, Batch Learning, Online Learning):**
    *   **Planning** is presented as a **purely computational question** to efficiently determine actions leading to good policies, and it "comes up anyways" even within learning problems when an agent might build a model to plan.
    *   **Batch Learning** addresses practical concerns where entities (e.g., countries, healthcare systems) are **"too scared to let your algorithm control their systems" interactively**. It focuses on extracting a good policy from existing data to *prove* its efficacy, similar to supervised learning, without direct environmental interaction.
    *   **Online Learning** is the **classic interactive reinforcement learning** where the agent learns by directly interacting with an unknown environment, taking actions, receiving rewards, and aiming to collect as much reward as possible.

*   **The Overarching Goal of the Class:**
    *   Beyond specific definitions, the class aims to teach students **how theoreticians approach reinforcement learning problems**.
    *   A key goal is for students to be able to **read and critically evaluate current research papers**, placing them within the existing literature, and perhaps even **asking and answering similar research questions** themselves. This involves teaching not only the problems but also the tools and techniques used to solve them.

Our conversation has established the fundamental components of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their role in reinforcement learning. Building upon that, the sources offer several additional nuanced insights, particularly regarding the underlying motivations, theoretical foundations, and the pedagogical approach of the class:

*   **The Nature of MDP Primitives**:
    *   States (S) and actions (A) are described as "primitives" within an MDP. This means they are fundamental, undefined elements within the mathematical model itself; their specific **meaning is application-dependent**. For example, a "state" for a robot arm differs from a "state" in a healthcare system, but both function as the abstract state in an MDP.
    *   While the source simplifies by assuming finite sets for S and A to avoid complex measure theory, it emphasizes that "big finite" sets still capture "most of your troubles" in practical applications, despite not fitting into a computer's memory. This choice "frees our mind from a lot of the measuratic weirdness" that would otherwise occur.

*   **Reward Structure and Discounting Rationale**:
    *   Rewards (R) are explicitly defined as **deterministic real numbers for every state-action pair** (s, a). They might sometimes be normalized (e.g., to or [-1,1]) to "keep everything under control".
    *   The primary reason for using a discount factor (gamma) is to ensure the **infinite sum of rewards (the "return") is well-defined and convergent**, preventing issues where the sum might not exist.
    *   The effective horizon of a discounted problem is approximately `1/(1 - gamma)`. Rewards collected beyond this horizon have a negligible impact on the total sum for a given accuracy.
    *   Discounting is chosen over other methods like taking averages because averages can lead to "nasty issues," such as **not being defined due to cyclic behaviors**. Discounting is preferred for its "relative simplicity".

*   **Policies: Generality and Measurability**:
    *   A policy (π) is designed to be very general: it can be **randomized** (choosing actions probabilistically) and can utilize the **entire history** of the process (all past states and actions) to decide on the next action. This generality is adopted to avoid "los[ing] generality by just assuming from the get-go that you can't use the whole history".
    *   For the probability measures defining trajectories to be well-defined, policies must satisfy "regularity assumptions" and be **"probability kernels"**. This means that for any history, the policy assigns a probability measure to actions, and if a subset of actions is fixed, the probability assigned to that subset must be a **measurable function of the history**. This property is crucial for composing probability measures (from the policy and the MDP's transitions) to properly define the induced measure over trajectories. The **Ionoscope Tulaska theorem** is mentioned as the tool that allows for the proper construction of this induced probability measure.

*   **The "Observed State" Assumption as a Theoretical Benchmark**:
    *   The assumption that the agent can fully observe the state of the system is acknowledged as a "very high bar" and a "non-trivial assumption" in practical settings.
    *   The theoretical justification for this assumption in foundational MDP theory is to **understand the "theoretical limits" of what can be achieved**, effectively setting an "upper bound" on collectable reward. It serves as a good starting point for building basic intuition and theory, even though the course will later address scenarios where state information must be abstracted due to immense state spaces.

*   **Deeper Motivations for the Three Learning Blocks**:
    *   **Planning:** This is primarily a **computational question** about efficiently determining optimal actions. It is foundational because planning problems "come up anyways" even within learning scenarios, for instance, when an agent builds a model of the environment and then needs to plan using that model.
    *   **Batch Learning:** This block addresses practical concerns where entities (e.g., countries, healthcare systems, patients) are **"too scared to let your algorithm control their systems" interactively**. Batch learning focuses on extracting a good policy from existing, pre-collected data. A key nuance is that the goal isn't just to find a good policy, but often to **"prove to these decision makers that you did something wrong"** or that your policy is better, which aligns with real-world applications in sensitive domains.
    *   **Online Learning:** This is the classic interactive reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns by directly interacting with an unknown environment to collect as much reward as possible.

*   **Course Pedagogical Goals and Project Types**:
    *   Beyond teaching problems and solutions, a core aim of the class is to educate students on **"how theoreticians think about reinforcement learning"**.
    *   A major success metric for the instructor is if students can **read and critically evaluate current research papers** in the literature, place them within existing knowledge, and "maybe ask similar questions and then maybe answer some of these questions" themselves.
    *   The project types explicitly reflect this goal: students can perform **critical evaluations or commentaries on existing papers**, review an entire research area, rewrite a paper (e.g., to make proofs clearer or shorter), or **attempt to extend results from one setting (e.g., general RL) to a simpler one (e.g., bandits) or vice-versa**. This last type specifically encourages **"transporting these ideas from one setting to another,"** asking if results hold in different contexts.


The relationship between Policy Measurability and Probability Kernels is a nuanced aspect of the theoretical foundations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), primarily concerning how to rigorously define the probability distributions over trajectories.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Policies in MDPs**:
    *   A **policy (π)** in an MDP determines how an agent chooses actions. It is defined very generally, allowing it to be **randomized** (choosing actions probabilistically) and to base its decisions on the **entire history** of the process, including all past states and actions. This history at time *t* consists of all past state-action pairs up to that point, represented as `(s0, a0, s1, a1, ..., st)`.
    *   Formally, a policy at time *t* is a map that takes a history `(ht)` and returns a **probability distribution over actions**.

*   **The Challenge of Measure Theory**:
    *   To define the "value" of a policy, which is the **expected return** (the expected sum of discounted rewards over an infinite trajectory), we need a **well-defined probability distribution over these infinite trajectories**.
    *   However, constructing such probability measures on arbitrary sets of states and actions (especially if they are continuous or infinite) requires sophisticated mathematical tools from measure theory. The instructor explicitly states the desire to "avoid measure theory" and "measuratic weirdness" in the class for simplicity.

*   **The Role of "Probability Kernels"**:
    *   For the joint probability measure over trajectories (induced by the MDP's transitions and the policy's action choices) to be properly defined, policies must satisfy certain **"regularity assumptions"**. These assumptions ensure that the policy acts as a **"probability kernel"**.
    *   A policy `πt` is a probability kernel if it maps histories `(ht)` to probability distributions over actions, and importantly, this mapping has specific measurability properties.

*   **Policy Measurability Explained**:
    *   Specifically, if you consider a **measurable subset of the action set**, the probability assigned to that subset by the policy must be a **measurable function of the history**. In simpler terms, as the history changes, the probability the policy assigns to a given group of actions needs to vary in a "well-behaved" (measurable) way.
    *   This **measurability of the policy as a function of the history** is crucial because it allows the composition of probability measures. Without it, you cannot properly combine the MDP's stochastic transition probabilities with the policy's action probabilities to define the joint measure over the entire trajectory space.
    *   This property becomes "really nasty" when discussing whether an **optimal policy even exists or if it must be measurable**.

*   **The Ionoscope Tulaska Theorem**:
    *   The **Ionoscope Tulaska theorem** is cited as a key mathematical tool that, given policies defined as probability kernels, allows for the **proper construction of the induced probability measure on the trajectory space**. This theorem validates that the products of probabilities (from the initial state distribution, policy action choices, and MDP transitions) indeed lead to a well-defined probability distribution over infinite trajectories.

*   **Simplification in the Course's Pedagogy**:
    *   To bypass these complex measure-theoretic discussions, the course makes a foundational assumption: **finite sets of states (S) and actions (A)**.
    *   In finite sets, probability distributions become "totally trivial" – essentially just probability vectors – making the concepts "super simple and very very intuitive".
    *   Despite this simplification, the instructor emphasizes that working with **"big finite" sets** (where the number of states or actions might be too large to fit in a computer's memory) still captures "most of your troubles" and practical challenges in reinforcement learning. This pedagogical choice "frees our mind from a lot of the measuratic weirdness" while still addressing practical scale.


That's an insightful question, delving into the underlying measure-theoretic foundations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While the specific term "push-forward measures" is **not explicitly used** in the provided sources, the **concept it describes – how probability measures are *induced* or *constructed* on the space of trajectories due to the interaction of the agent's policy and the MDP's dynamics – is central to the discussion.**

Here's how the sources address this relationship:

*   **The Need for a Probability Measure on Trajectories**: To calculate the "expected return" (the expected sum of discounted rewards) for a given policy, a well-defined probability distribution over the infinite trajectories is essential. Without this, the expectation wouldn't be mathematically sound.
*   **The Interconnection of Policy and MDP**: The source explains that **fixing a policy and an MDP's transition structure "puts a distribution over the space of trajectories"**. This distribution is explicitly constructed by multiplying probabilities: starting with an initial state distribution, then multiplying by the policy's probability of choosing an action for a given history, and subsequently by the MDP's probability of transitioning to the next state given the current state and action. This sequential multiplication effectively defines the probability of any given trajectory.
*   **Policies as Probability Kernels and Measurability**: For this "induced measure" over trajectories to be rigorously well-defined, policies must satisfy certain "regularity assumptions" and act as **"probability kernels"**.
    *   A policy maps a history to a probability distribution over actions.
    *   The crucial measurability property is that for any **measurable subset of the action set**, the probability assigned to that subset by the policy must be a **measurable function of the history**. This ensures that as the history changes, the policy's probabilities vary in a "well-behaved" way, which is vital for properly **composing probability measures** (from the policy and the MDP's transitions) to define the joint measure over trajectories.
    *   The instructor notes that without this property, "the definitions wouldn't work" for defining joint measures.
*   **The Ionoscope Tulaska Theorem**: This theorem is specifically mentioned as the mathematical tool that **"allows you to construct this probability measure on the trajectory space"**. It provides the theoretical underpinning, confirming that if policies are defined as probability kernels with the required measurability, then the jointly induced probability measure over the entire infinite trajectory space is well-defined.
*   **Simplification for Pedagogical Reasons**: The course intentionally simplifies by assuming **finite sets for states (S) and actions (A)** to "put your mind at ease" and "keep things simple". In finite settings, probability distributions are "totally trivial," reducing to simple probability vectors, thus making the concepts "super simple and very very intuitive" and avoiding the "measuratic weirdness" of continuous spaces and advanced measure theory. However, the underlying need for these theoretical foundations remains for more general (e.g., continuous) state and action spaces.

In essence, while the term "push-forward measures" isn't used, the discussion precisely outlines the mechanism by which the policy and the MDP "push forward" probability distributions from initial states and actions to define a comprehensive probability measure over the entire sequence of states and actions (trajectories), facilitated by the mathematical framework of probability kernels and supported by theorems like Ionoscope Tulaska.


The interconnection structure in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) refers to the **closed-loop system** formed by the agent's policy interacting with the MDP's dynamics. This interaction is fundamental because it **induces a well-defined probability distribution over the space of infinite trajectories**.

Here's a detailed breakdown of this structure:

*   **The Components**:
    *   **The Controller/Agent with a Policy (π)**: This is the part that determines how actions are chosen. A policy can be randomized, meaning it chooses actions probabilistically, and it can base its decisions on the entire history of the process (past states and actions) up to the current time.
    *   **The MDP Transition Dynamics**: This represents the environment itself, dictating the **stochastic transitions** between states based on the current state and the action taken. If you are in state $s$ and take action $a$, there's a distribution over possible next states.

*   **The Closed Loop**:
    *   The agent, guided by its policy, **sends actions** to the MDP.
    *   In response, the agent **receives state information** (or other information) from the MDP.
    *   This continuous cycle of action, transition, and observation creates a **feedback loop**, which is why it's called a closed-loop system.

*   **How the Distribution Over Trajectories is Formed**:
    *   When you **fix a policy** (how the agent acts) and **fix an MDP's transition structure** (how the environment responds), along with an **initial state distribution** (where the process starts), this collectively **"puts a distribution over the space of trajectories"**. A trajectory is an infinite sequence of states and actions, like $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \ldots)$.
    *   The probability of a particular sequence (trajectory) is defined as an **infinite product** of probabilities:
        1.  The probability of the initial state, given by the initial state distribution ($\mu(s_0)$).
        2.  The probability of the action chosen by the policy at each step, given the history up to that point ($\pi_t(a_t | h_t)$).
        3.  The probability of transitioning to the next state according to the MDP's dynamics ($P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$).
    *   This means the probabilities "just get multiplied," indicating that everything happens independently given the past, which aligns with the Markov property.

*   **The Role of Policy Measurability and Probability Kernels**:
    *   For this induced probability measure on the trajectory space to be **mathematically well-defined** (avoiding "measuratic weirdness"), policies must satisfy certain "regularity assumptions".
    *   Specifically, a policy must act as a **"probability kernel"**. This implies that:
        *   The policy maps histories to probability distributions over actions.
        *   For any **measurable subset of the action set**, the probability assigned to that subset by the policy must be a **measurable function of the history**. This measurability is critical for correctly composing (multiplying) the probability measures from the policy and the MDP's transitions to define the joint measure over trajectories. Without this, "the definitions wouldn't work".
    *   The **Ionoscope Tulaska theorem** is cited as the mathematical tool that allows for the **construction of this probability measure on the trajectory space**, validating that if policies are defined as probability kernels, then the induced measure is well-defined and "everything works".

*   **Simplification in the Course**:
    *   To simplify the pedagogical approach and avoid the complexities of measure theory, the course assumes **finite sets for states (S) and actions (A)**. In this context, probability distributions are "totally trivial" and become simple probability vectors, making the concepts "super simple and very very intuitive". This choice "frees our mind from a lot of the measuratic weirdness", while still allowing the study of "big finite" sets that capture most practical challenges.

In essence, the interconnection structure is the dynamic feedback loop where the policy and MDP collaborate, and its rigorous definition relies on policies having specific measurability properties that allow the construction of a valid probability measure over the resulting trajectories.


The "Observed State" assumption in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) serves as a **crucial theoretical benchmark** and simplifies the initial mathematical framework for understanding optimal control.

Here's an expansion of this discussion:

*   **What "Observed State" Means**:
    *   The assumption implies that the **controller or agent can fully observe the current state of the system** at each time step.
    *   This means that when a policy is making a decision, it has access to the precise state information. In the most general definition of a policy, it's allowed to choose actions based on the *entire history* of the process up to the current state. The history includes all past states and actions.

*   **The Role as a Theoretical Benchmark**:
    *   The primary justification for starting with this assumption is to establish the **"limits of like how well you could control the system to collect so much reward"**.
    *   By allowing the controller to know the exact state, the theory explores the **"really extreme case"** of perfect information. This "puts an **upper bound on how much reward you could collect**".
    *   It represents a **"very high bar"** for what's achievable. By understanding the optimal performance under this ideal condition, theoreticians can gain intuition and build a foundational understanding of MDPs.

*   **Simplification and Pedagogical Choice**:
    *   The "Observed State" assumption, alongside the simplification of assuming **finite sets for states (S) and actions (A)**, helps to **"keep things simple"** in the initial stages of learning about MDPs.
    *   In finite settings, probability distributions are "totally trivial" and "super simple and very very intuitive," which "frees our mind from a lot of the measuratic weirdness" that would otherwise arise with continuous state or action spaces. This also alleviates the complex "regularity assumptions" and measure theory typically required for policies to be properly defined as "probability kernels" in more general settings.
    *   The instructor notes that "big finite" sets can capture most practical challenges without diving into measure theory complexities.

*   **Moving Beyond the Benchmark**:
    *   While essential for building foundations, the course acknowledges that the "Observed State" assumption is a **"non-trivial assumption"**.
    *   In real-world scenarios and later parts of the course, there will be discussions about situations where it's **"not practically feasible"** to fully utilize observed state information, even if it were available. This might be due to an overwhelmingly large number of states, necessitating the compression or abstraction of state information. The challenge then becomes how to still "guarantee that you're going to do well" with less information.

In the context of discounting within Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), **epsilon ($\epsilon$) is used to quantify the desired accuracy when approximating the infinite sum of discounted rewards by a finite sum**.

Here's an expansion on its role:

*   **Effective Horizon and Truncation:** The concept of an "effective horizon" is introduced, which is roughly defined as $1/(1-\gamma)$. This horizon indicates that after a certain number of steps, the future rewards become negligibly small due to the exponential decay caused by the discount factor $\gamma$.
*   **Accuracy Quantification:** Epsilon is specifically mentioned in relation to this effective horizon to provide a **bound on the error of truncating the infinite sum**. If you are interested in maximizing the infinite discounted sum of rewards up to an $\epsilon$ accuracy, you can effectively truncate the sum after approximately $1/(1-\gamma)$ terms.
*   **Guarantee of Small Remainder:** If rewards are bounded (e.g., in $$ or $[-1, 1]$), then after a sufficient number of steps (approximately $1/(1-\gamma)$ steps), the *remainder* of the infinite sum (the part that is truncated away) will be small, in the range of $\epsilon$. This means that if you maximize the truncated sum to an $\epsilon$ accuracy, you are also effectively maximizing the original infinite sum to a similar accuracy.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** At the initial stage of the course, this explanation of epsilon's role is meant to provide a "high level, conceptual understanding" rather than a formal proof. The main takeaway is that **discounting introduces an exponential decay, making the contribution of future rewards negligible after a certain time, allowing for a practical "effective horizon" defined by this accuracy level**.


Epsilon ($\epsilon$) plays a specific role in the context of discounting in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by **quantifying the accuracy** of approximating an infinite sum of rewards.

Here's an expansion of the insights involved:

*   **The Problem of Infinite Returns**: When an agent interacts with an MDP, it generates an infinite sequence of states and actions, each yielding a reward. Summing these rewards over an infinite trajectory often leads to an ill-defined or infinite sum, making it impossible to maximize the return.
*   **Discounting as a Solution**: To address this, a **discount factor, $\gamma$**, which is a number between zero and one ($\gamma \in [0, 1)$), is introduced. This factor exponentially reduces the value of future rewards, ensuring that the infinite sum of rewards converges to a finite value, assuming individual rewards are bounded (e.g., in $$ or $[-1, 1]$). The return is calculated as $R = r_0 + \gamma r_1 + \gamma^2 r_2 + \dots$.
*   **Epsilon and the "Effective Horizon"**: The concept of an "effective horizon" is introduced, which is approximately **$1/(1-\gamma)$**. This horizon represents a conceptual time limit beyond which rewards contribute very little to the total sum due to the exponential decay of $\gamma^t$ as $t$ increases.
*   **Quantifying Accuracy with Epsilon**: Epsilon ($\epsilon$) is used to make this "effective horizon" more precise in terms of desired accuracy. If you aim to maximize the infinite discounted sum of rewards up to an **$\epsilon$ accuracy**, you can conceptually (and later formally) consider truncating the sum after a certain number of terms, roughly related to $1/(1-\gamma)$ and $\epsilon$.
*   **Guarantee of Small Remainder**: The core insight is that **discounting causes an exponential decay** of the value of future rewards. This means that after a sufficient number of steps (related to the effective horizon and $\epsilon$), the *remainder* of the infinite sum (the part you would be ignoring or truncating) will be very small, within the range of $\epsilon$. Therefore, if you maximize the truncated sum to an $\epsilon$ accuracy, you are also effectively maximizing the original infinite sum to a similar accuracy.
*   **Conceptual Understanding**: At this foundational stage of learning MDPs, the mention of epsilon in this context is intended to provide a **high-level, conceptual understanding** of how discounting practically limits the influence of the distant future. It's an intuition-building step, with more precise formalizations to come later. The main takeaway is that discounting ensures that rewards become "negligible" beyond a certain point, and epsilon helps to define what "negligible" means for a given problem.

The **trajectory space** in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is central to defining and evaluating an agent's performance, particularly because it addresses how rewards are accumulated over time and how uncertainty is managed.

Here are the key insights and aspects special about trajectory space:

*   **Definition of a Trajectory**: A trajectory is an **infinite sequence of states and actions** that an agent generates by interacting with the environment. It starts from an initial state ($s_0$), proceeds with an action ($a_0$), transitions to a new state ($s_1$), takes another action ($a_1$), and so on, continuing indefinitely ($s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots$). The **trajectory space** itself is the set of all possible such infinite sequences of state-action pairs.

*   **Foundation for the Objective (The Return)**: For every consecutive pair of states and actions within a trajectory, there's an underlying reward. The agent's objective is to **sum up these rewards** over the entire trajectory to form what is called the "return".

*   **Challenges of Infinite Sums**: A significant problem arises because this is an **infinite sum of rewards**, which may not be well-defined. For instance, a sum like `+1, -1, +1, -1...` might not converge, or if all rewards are positive (e.g., `+1, +1, +1...`), the sum would go to infinity. To handle this, **discounting** is introduced, using a discount factor $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ to ensure the infinite sum converges to a finite value by making future rewards matter less.

*   **Stochastic Nature and Distribution over Trajectories**: Since transitions within an MDP are **stochastic**, and policies can also choose actions randomly, the specific trajectory generated is not deterministic. Instead, there's a **probability distribution over trajectories**.
    *   This distribution is "induced jointly" by the initial state distribution ($\mu$), the agent's policy ($\pi$), and the MDP's stochastic transition dynamics ($P$).
    *   The probability of a specific trajectory $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots)$ is defined as an infinite product: $\mu(s_0) \times \pi_0(a_0 | s_0) \times P(s_1 | s_0, a_0) \times \pi_1(a_1 | s_0, a_0, s_1) \times P(s_2 | s_1, a_1) \times \dots$. This implies the Markov property holds, where probabilities "just get multiplied" based on the current state and action.

*   **Well-Definedness and Measurability**: A critical mathematical challenge related to trajectory space is proving that this infinite product indeed leads to a **well-defined probability measure** over the infinitely lengthy trajectories. This requires policies to possess specific "regularity assumptions" and be defined as **probability kernels** (functions mapping histories to probability distributions over actions). The **Ionescu Tulcea Theorem** is the theoretical cornerstone that allows for the construction of this probability measure on the trajectory space.

*   **Simplification in Course for Tractability**: To avoid the "measuratic weirdness" and the complexities of measure theory required for proving measurability in continuous state/action spaces, the course primarily **assumes finite state and action sets**. This simplification makes probability distributions "super simple and very very intuitive," where they can be treated as probability vectors. This approach allows for a "good enough starting point" for building foundational theory.

*   **Basis for Policy Value**: The core objective in MDPs is to find a policy that maximizes the expected return. The **value of a policy** is formally defined as the **expected value of the return** taken over this distribution of trajectories, which is induced by the interconnection of the policy and the MDP. This means that the value function for a policy is fundamentally an aggregation over all possible trajectories that could arise under that policy and the environment's dynamics.


The "big finite" assumption in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is primarily made to **simplify the nature of probability distributions at each individual step**, aiming to avoid the complexities of measure theory. However, when dealing with **infinite trajectories**, the need for measure theory persists due to the fundamental challenges of defining probability measures over infinite product spaces, even if the individual sets are finite.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the case:

*   **Simplification with "Big Finite" Sets**: The course assumes finite state ($S$) and action ($A$) sets to simplify the mathematical treatment. With finite sets, probability distributions become "super simple and very very intuitive" as they can be treated as "probability vectors". This helps avoid the complexities of defining measures on arbitrary (potentially continuous) sets, which would require formalizing concepts like sigma-algebras and measurable functions from the outset.
*   **Definition of a Trajectory**: A trajectory is an **infinite sequence** of states and actions ($s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots$) [1 Trajectory Definition from previous turn, 13, 19]. The probability of a specific trajectory is defined as an **infinite product** of the initial state probability ($\mu(s_0)$), the policy's action probabilities ($\pi_t(a_t | \text{history}_t)$), and the environment's transition probabilities ($P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$). This product looks like: $\mu(s_0) \times \pi_0(a_0 | s_0) \times P(s_1 | s_0, a_0) \times \pi_1(a_1 | s_0, a_0, s_1) \times P(s_2 | s_1, a_1) \times \dots$.
*   **The Problem of Infinite Products and Well-Definedness**: Even with finite state and action sets, the instructor highlights a crucial question regarding this infinite product: "I know you might be wondering about okay is this even valid this is an infinite product this is always zero maybe what not like it's like a lot of numbers are multiplied here". The challenge lies in proving that this infinite product indeed leads to a **well-defined probability measure** over the space of infinitely lengthy trajectories. Simply having finite discrete values for each step does not automatically guarantee the validity of the measure over the infinite sequence.
*   **Measure Theory's Role in Infinite Trajectories**: To formally prove that this infinite product constitutes a well-defined probability measure, mathematical rigor from measure theory is required. This involves:
    *   **Regularity Assumptions**: Policies must possess specific "regularity assumptions" and be defined as **probability kernels**. A probability kernel implies that the map from histories ($h_t$) to probability distributions over actions ($M_1(A)$) must itself be "measurable as a function of the history".
    *   **Composition of Measures**: Without these properties, it's not possible to "properly define the induced measure" or "compose these probability measures" to get the joint measure over an infinite sequence. The definitions simply "wouldn't work".
    *   **Ionescu Tulcea Theorem**: This theorem is the theoretical cornerstone that explicitly "allows you to construct this probability measure on the trajectory space" when policies are defined as these probability kernels. This theorem is essential for ensuring the mathematical validity of the infinite product definition for trajectory probabilities.

Therefore, while the "big finite" assumption simplifies the *local* definition of probability distributions at each step (making them simple vectors), it **does not fully circumvent the need for measure theory** when defining probabilities over *infinite sequences of events*. The inherent nature of constructing a probability measure for an infinite product space still necessitates the formal machinery of measure theory, as evidenced by the explicit mention of probability kernels and the Ionescu Tulcea Theorem for ensuring the well-definedness of the distribution over trajectories.

The Reinforcement Learning (RL) constructs discussed in the sources build upon the fundamental concept of a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** in a hierarchical manner. An MDP serves as the mathematical model for the environment, and other elements are introduced to define an agent's interaction within this environment, measure its performance, and ultimately guide its learning or planning.

Here's a taxonomy of how these constructs build on the MDP:

*   **1. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) itself**:
    *   An MDP is a **mathematical model used to represent an environment** where stochastic transitions between states occur, controlled by an agent. It is "at the heart" of planning, batch learning, and online learning.
    *   **Primitives/Components of an MDP**:
        *   **States ($S$)**: A set of states, which are primitive and represent different configurations of the environment. For simplicity, this set is often assumed to be **finite**.
        *   **Actions ($A$)**: A set of actions that the agent can take, also primitive. This set is also often assumed to be **finite** for simplicity.
        *   **Stochastic Transitions ($P$)**: Defines the probability distribution over the next state ($s'$) given the current state ($s$) and an action ($a$), denoted as $P(s' | s, a)$. This means that taking an action from a given state does not deterministically lead to a single next state, but rather to a distribution of possible next states.
        *   **Rewards ($R$)**: For every state-action pair $(s, a)$, there is an associated deterministic reward (a real number). Rewards can be positive or negative.
        *   **Objective Function**: The overall goal is to maximize the **sum of future rewards**. To make this infinite sum well-defined, a **discount factor ($\gamma$)** (a number between 0 and 1) is introduced, which means future rewards matter less than immediate ones. This discounted sum is called the **Return**.

*   **2. The Policy ($\pi$)**:
    *   A policy is the **control policy** of the agent, defining how it chooses actions.
    *   In its most general form, a policy can:
        *   Take the **entire history of the process** (sequence of states and actions up to the current state) as input.
        *   Choose actions **randomly** (assign a probability distribution over actions for a given history). This is denoted as $\pi_t(a_t | \text{history}_t)$ or $\pi_t(a_t | s_0, a_0, s_1, \dots, s_t)$.
    *   The assumption of **finite state and action sets** simplifies the representation of these probability distributions as "probability vectors," avoiding the immediate need for complex measure theory at each step. However, defining probabilities over *infinite sequences* still requires measure theory for mathematical well-definedness.

*   **3. The Trajectory**:
    *   A trajectory is an **infinite sequence of states and actions** generated by the agent interacting with the environment. It takes the form $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, \dots)$.
    *   The **trajectory space** is the set of all such possible infinite sequences of state-action pairs.

*   **4. The Distribution Over Trajectories**:
    *   This is a **probability distribution over the entire trajectory space**. It is **induced jointly** by the **initial state distribution ($\mu$)**, the **agent's policy ($\pi$)**, and the **MDP's stochastic transition dynamics ($P$)**.
    *   The probability of a specific trajectory $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots)$ is defined as an **infinite product**: $\mu(s_0) \times \pi_0(a_0 | s_0) \times P(s_1 | s_0, a_0) \times \pi_1(a_1 | s_0, a_0, s_1) \times P(s_2 | s_1, a_1) \times \dots$.
    *   This infinite product is "well defined" and leads to a probability distribution over infinitely long trajectories. This relies on policies being defined as **probability kernels** and requires concepts from **measure theory** (specifically, the Ionescu Tulcea Theorem) to prove its validity. This ensures that probabilities can be properly composed across an infinite sequence.

*   **5. Value of a Policy**:
    *   Once the distribution over trajectories is established, the **value of a policy ($\text{V}_{\pi}(\mu)$)** for a given initial state distribution ($\mu$) is defined as the **expected return** over this induced distribution of trajectories.
    *   Essentially, $V_{\pi}(\mu) = \mathbb{E}_{\text{trajectory} \sim \text{Distribution over Trajectories}}[\text{Return}(\text{trajectory})]$.
    *   For practical purposes, it's often sufficient to consider the value of a policy starting from a single state, denoted as $\text{V}_{\pi}(s)$, which is the expected return if the agent starts in state $s$.

*   **6. Optimal Value and Optimal Policy**:
    *   With the value of a policy defined as a real number, it becomes possible to identify the **optimal value** as the "supremum over all policies" for a given starting state distribution.
    *   An **optimal policy** is one that achieves this maximum possible expected return.

This hierarchical structure demonstrates how the MDP provides the foundational model of the environment, the policy defines the agent's behavior within it, and together they induce a distribution over possible outcomes (trajectories). This distribution then allows for the rigorous definition of a policy's performance (its value), leading to the goal of finding an optimal policy in reinforcement learning.


The constructs in Reinforcement Learning (RL) are built hierarchically on the **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, which serves as the fundamental mathematical model of the environment. Each subsequent construct relies on the definitions provided by the MDP and previous constructs to make sense.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how each construct builds upon and depends on the MDP:

### 1. The Markov Decision Process (MDP)

The MDP is the **"heart"** of planning, batch learning, and online learning in RL. It is a **mathematical model** designed to represent an environment where stochastic transitions between states are controlled by an agent.

*   **Core Components of an MDP**:
    *   **States ($S$)**: A set of environmental configurations. These are considered **primitive** (undefined beyond being a set). For simplicity in the course, the state set is often assumed to be **finite**.
    *   **Actions ($A$)**: A set of actions the agent can take, also primitive. Like states, the action set is often assumed to be **finite** to simplify the mathematics.
    *   **Stochastic Transitions ($P$)**: Defines a **probability distribution** over the next state ($s'$) given the current state ($s$) and an action ($a$), denoted as $P(s' | s, a)$. This means that an action from a given state leads to a *distribution* of possible next states, not a single deterministic one.
    *   **Rewards ($R$)**: For every state-action pair $(s, a)$, there is an associated **deterministic reward** (a real number). The goal is to maximize the **sum of future rewards**.
    *   **Objective Function (Return) and Discount Factor ($\gamma$)**: To handle the issue of infinite sums of rewards potentially not being well-defined, a **discount factor ($\gamma$)**, a number between 0 and 1, is introduced. This factor ensures that future rewards are weighted less than immediate ones, making the sum (called the **Return**) well-defined. The use of discounting simplifies the problem compared to, for example, average rewards, which introduce "nasty issues".

### 2. The Policy ($\pi$)

A policy is the **control policy of the agent**. It dictates **how the agent chooses actions** within the MDP.

*   **Dependency on MDP**: A policy operates *within* the state and action spaces defined by the MDP.
*   **General Definition**: A general policy can:
    *   Utilize the **entire history** of the process up to the current state ($s_0, a_0, s_1, \dots, s_t$) to make a decision.
    *   Choose actions **randomly**, assigning a probability distribution over actions for a given history. This is represented as a map from histories ($H_t$) to probability distributions over actions ($M_1(A)$) for each time index $t$.
*   **"Big Finite" Simplification**: The assumption of **finite state and action sets** is made to **avoid the complexities of measure theory** at the local step level. With finite sets, probability distributions are "super simple and very very intuitive," treated as "probability vectors". This simplifies understanding by "freeing our mind from a lot of the measuratic weirdness" that would otherwise occur.

### 3. The Trajectory

A trajectory is an **infinite sequence of states and actions** that results from an agent's interaction with an MDP.

*   **Dependency on MDP and Policy**: A trajectory is generated by the **interconnection** of the agent's policy and the MDP's transition dynamics. It starts from an initial state, the policy chooses an action, the MDP transitions to a new state, and this process continues indefinitely.
*   **Structure**: A trajectory is represented as $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, \dots)$. The **trajectory space** is the set of all such possible infinite sequences.

### 4. The Distribution Over Trajectories

This is a **probability distribution defined over the entire trajectory space**. It quantifies the likelihood of any given infinite sequence of states and actions occurring.

*   **Dependency on MDP, Policy, and Initial State Distribution**: This distribution is **induced jointly** by:
    *   An **initial state distribution ($\mu$)** over $S$.
    *   The **agent's policy ($\pi$)**.
    *   The **MDP's stochastic transition dynamics ($P$)**.
*   **Definition as an Infinite Product**: The probability of a specific trajectory $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots)$ is expressed as an **infinite product**:
    $\mu(s_0) \times \pi_0(a_0 | s_0) \times P(s_1 | s_0, a_0) \times \pi_1(a_1 | s_0, a_0, s_1) \times P(s_2 | s_1, a_1) \times \dots$.
*   **Measure Theory's Necessity**: Even with finite state and action sets, the instructor acknowledges that one "might be wondering about okay is this even valid this is an infinite product this is always zero maybe what not". To prove that this infinite product is **well-defined** and constitutes a proper probability measure over the infinite trajectory space, **measure theory is required**. Specifically, policies must be defined as **probability kernels**, meaning the map from histories to probability distributions over actions must be **"measurable as a function of the history"**. The **Ionescu Tulcea Theorem** is the theoretical cornerstone that "allows you to construct this probability measure on the trajectory space" under these conditions. Without these "regularity assumptions" on policies, the definitions "wouldn't work" to "properly define the induced measure" or "compose these probability measures".

### 5. Value of a Policy

The value of a policy quantifies its performance within the MDP framework.

*   **Dependency on Trajectory Distribution and MDP's Return**: The **value of a policy ($\text{V}_{\pi}(\mu)$)**, for a given initial state distribution ($\mu$), is defined as the **expected return** over the distribution of trajectories induced by that policy and the MDP.
    *   The **Return** itself is derived directly from the MDP's rewards and discount factor over a trajectory.
    *   The **expectation** is taken with respect to the **distribution over trajectories**.
*   **Single State Value**: It is often sufficient to study the value starting from a single state, denoted as $\text{V}_{\pi}(s)$, which is the expected return if the agent starts in state $s$.

### 6. Optimal Value and Optimal Policy

These represent the ultimate goals in many RL problems: finding the best possible performance and the behavior that achieves it.

*   **Dependency on Policy Value**: Once the value of a policy is a well-defined real number, it becomes possible to identify the **optimal value** as the **supremum over all policies** for a given starting state distribution.
*   An **optimal policy** is then defined as the policy that achieves this maximum expected return. The fundamental theorem of MDPs suggests that knowing the starting state is often sufficient to act optimally.

In essence, the MDP lays out the rules of the game (states, actions, transitions, rewards). The policy defines how the agent plays that game. Together with an initial state, they determine the possible outcomes, or trajectories, and their probabilities. This probability distribution then allows for the rigorous mathematical definition of a policy's performance (its value), which in turn allows for the identification of optimal behavior. Measure theory becomes crucial at the point of defining probabilities over infinite sequences, even if individual steps are finite.


The conversation has already established the foundational concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) constructs building hierarchically on the Markov Decision Process (MDP). To provide nuanced insights that go beyond a mere summary, we can delve into the justifications, complexities, and underlying mathematical considerations mentioned in the sources.

Here are some nuanced insights:

*   **Simplifications in the MDP Definition**:
    *   **Deterministic Rewards (for Simplicity)**: While rewards are generally part of the MDP definition, the instructor makes a deliberate choice to assume that "for every state-action pair there is a **deterministic reward**". This is explicitly stated as a simplification "to reduce clutter", implying that in a more complex or general setting, rewards could also be stochastic.
    *   **Discounting as a Practical Choice**: The use of a **discount factor ($\gamma$)** is not just an arbitrary choice for the objective function. It's introduced primarily "to deal with the fact that the sum may not be defined" for infinite sums of rewards. The alternative of taking averages "would be to take averages if you take averages then there are all kinds of **nasty issues** whether the averages are defined maybe there is some cyclic behavior again and averages are not defined then you have to take chisel over ages". The discounted problem is studied because it's "somehow interesting but relatively simple" and "captures a little bit about that maybe the future is not that important a very long future". It also implies an **"effective horizon"** of roughly $1/(1-\gamma)$ terms, meaning that beyond this point, rewards contribute negligibly to the total discounted sum.

*   **The Depth of Policy Definition and the "Big Finite" Compromise**:
    *   **Generality of Policies**: A general policy is defined very broadly: it can use the **entire history** of the process up to the current state (e.g., $s_0, a_0, s_1, \dots, s_t$) to make decisions and can choose actions **randomly**. The instructor notes that this broad definition is chosen to "not lose generality" from the outset, even if the practical reasons for full history dependence or randomization aren't immediately obvious.
    *   **The Necessity of Measure Theory**: Even with seemingly simple components like finite states and actions, rigorously defining the **distribution over trajectories** (the infinite sequence of states and actions) requires sophisticated mathematical tools. The instructor highlights that to prove that the "infinite product" representing the probability of a trajectory is "well defined" and constitutes a proper probability measure, **measure theory is required**. Policies must be formally defined as **probability kernels** (measurable maps from histories to probability distributions over actions). Without these "regularity assumptions," the definitions "wouldn't work" to "properly define the induced measure" or "compose these probability measures". The **Ionescu Tulcea Theorem** is the theoretical cornerstone that "allows you to construct this probability measure on the trajectory space".
    *   **The "Big Finite" Solution**: To circumvent the complexities and "measuratic weirdness" of measure theory for most of the course, the instructor adopts a crucial simplification: assuming **finite state and action sets**. This makes probability distributions "super simple and very very intuitive," reducing them to "probability vectors". While acknowledging this is a limitation for continuous problems (e.g., robotics), the instructor suggests that "big finite" often captures the essence of challenges (e.g., computational barriers) and the hope is that results extend to continuous cases with sufficient assumptions.
    *   **Implicit Assumption of State Observability**: For foundational MDP theory, it's assumed that the controller **can observe the state**. This is a "very high bar" and implicitly defines the "limits of what you can do with the system," providing an **upper bound on collectible reward**. However, the instructor immediately contextualizes this, stating that much of the course will focus on cases where the state space is too large for practical direct observation and action, necessitating state abstraction.

*   **Interconnection and Expected Value**:
    *   The term **"interconnection"** is used to describe the joint action of the agent's policy and the MDP's transition structure in inducing the distribution over trajectories. This "closed loop system" represents how the agent's feedback influences future states and rewards.
    *   Because transitions are stochastic, the return of a policy is not a single value but has a **distribution**. Therefore, to define the "value of a policy," it's necessary to take the **expectation** of the return with respect to the induced distribution over trajectories.

*   **The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs**:
    *   Although not fully detailed in the provided excerpts, the instructor mentions that a **"fundamental theorem of MDPs"** will be taught, which states that "if you know we start that's pretty much sufficient to to know how to act optimally". This hints at the existence of stationary (time-independent) and often deterministic optimal policies.

*   **The Big Picture and Practical Relevance**:
    *   The course is structured into three main blocks: **Planning, Batch Learning, and Online Learning**. The MDP is placed at the "heart" of all three, underscoring its foundational role even in learning problems.
    *   **Batch learning**, a significant part of the course, is justified by practical concerns: "people are too scared to let your algorithm control their systems" directly. It allows for "proving that you have a better policy" using pre-collected data, which is crucial in high-stakes fields like healthcare. This highlights that RL theory, even abstract, is grounded in real-world constraints and applications.


The instructor introduces several mathematical simplifications or "obstructions" to the full complexity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to facilitate better understanding and reduce initial clutter. These pedagogical choices address deep mathematical challenges that would otherwise require advanced concepts like measure theory.

Here are the key mathematical obstructions and their justifications:

*   **Assumption of Finite State and Action Sets**:
    *   **The Obstruction**: To simplify the rigorous definition of probability measures on the "trajectory space" (infinite sequence of states and actions), the instructor assumes that the set of states ($S$) and the set of actions ($A$) are **finite**.
    *   **Why it's necessary**: Without this assumption, one would need to delve into **measure theory** to properly define distributions and composite probability measures, a topic that is "very hairy" and involves concepts like sigma algebras and probability kernels. The lecturer specifically mentions the **Ionescu Tulcea Theorem** as the theoretical tool needed to construct the probability measure on the trajectory space for general (non-finite) sets.
    *   **The Simplification**: With finite sets, probability distributions become "super simple and very very intuitive," reducing to **probability vectors**. This avoids "measuratic weirdness" and allows focusing on core concepts.
    *   **"Big Finite" Compromise**: While acknowledging that this is a limitation for continuous problems (e.g., in robotics), the instructor argues that "big finite" (where state/action spaces are very large but still finite) often captures the essence of challenges, especially computational barriers, and that many results extend to continuous cases under sufficient "regularity assumptions".

*   **Initial Assumption of Deterministic Rewards**:
    *   **The Obstruction**: For simplicity and "to reduce clutter," the instructor initially assumes that for every state-action pair, there is a **deterministic reward**.
    *   **Why it's necessary (simplification)**: This choice avoids the immediate complexity of dealing with stochastic rewards and their distributions, allowing a clearer introduction of the MDP structure and objective function. The general definition of an MDP allows for stochastic rewards, but this is a temporary simplification.

*   **Use of a Discount Factor ($\gamma$) for Objective Function**:
    *   **The Obstruction**: When defining the objective function as the sum of rewards over an infinite horizon, an **infinite sum of rewards** is naturally encountered. However, such a sum "may not even be defined" (e.g., oscillating sums like +1, -1, +1, -1, or an infinite sum of positive rewards).
    *   **The Simplification**: To manage this, a **discount factor ($\gamma$)** (a number between 0 and 1) is introduced. This factor exponentially decreases the value of future rewards, ensuring that the infinite sum of discounted rewards converges and is "well defined".
    *   **Avoiding "Nasty Issues"**: The alternative to discounting, such as taking averages of rewards, introduces "all kinds of nasty issues," including whether averages are defined, especially with cyclic behaviors. Discounting provides a "relatively simple" starting point that "captures a little bit about that maybe the future is not that important a very long future". It also implies an **"effective horizon"** of roughly $1/(1-\gamma)$ terms, beyond which rewards contribute negligibly to the total sum.

*   **Implicit Assumption of State Observability**:
    *   **The Obstruction**: For building the foundational theory of MDPs and defining policies, it is initially assumed that the controller **can observe the state** of the system.
    *   **Why it's necessary (simplification)**: This is described as a "very high bar" and a "non-trivial assumption". However, it serves as a starting point to understand the theoretical **limits of what can be done with the system** and provides an **upper bound on collectible reward**. It allows the definition of policies that act based on the history of observed states and actions.
    *   **Future Context**: The instructor notes that much of the course will later address scenarios where the state space is too large for practical direct observation and action, necessitating state abstraction and dealing with cases where the state is not fully observed.

These mathematical obstructions are deliberately introduced to simplify the initial learning curve, allowing students to grasp the core concepts of RL and MDPs before tackling the full mathematical rigor required for more general and complex scenarios.
