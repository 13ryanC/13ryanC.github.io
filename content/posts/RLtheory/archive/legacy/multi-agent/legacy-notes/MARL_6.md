The chapter groups the “classic” multi‑agent reinforcement‑learning methods into **five broad algorithm families**, each defined by the *assumptions they make about what the learner can observe and what equilibrium concept they target*:

| #     | Family                                                  | Core idea                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Typical representatives                                                                  | When to choose it                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Planning / Dynamic‑Programming for Stochastic Games** | Extend the Bellman backup to multi‑agent settings by replacing the single‑agent max‑operator with a game‑solver (minimax, Nash, correlated, etc.). Requires a full model of the dynamics and all reward functions.             | Shapley’s value‑iteration, policy‑iteration variants                                     | Small, tabular, perfectly‑observed games where an exact baseline or benchmark is needed.                                                                                |
| **2** | **Value‑Based Joint‑Action Learning (JAL)**             | Learn a *joint* Q‑table \(Q(s,a_1,\dots ,a_n)\) from experience and embed a game‑solver inside each update. Assumes each agent can see the joint action and the reward(s) of interest.                                           | Minimax‑Q, Nash‑Q, Correlated‑Q, Friend‑or‑Foe Q‑learning                                | Competitive or mixed‑motivation tasks where you can observe (or share) reward signals and need stronger convergence guarantees than independent Q‑learning provides.    |
| **3** | **Model‑Based / Best‑Response Learners**                | Build an explicit predictive model of the other agents’ policies from data and compute the best response against this model—often with a Bayesian “value‑of‑information” component to decide when to probe an opponent’s type. | JAL‑AM (Joint‑Action Learning with Agent Models), Bayesian Value‑of‑Information planners | Decentralised settings where you **cannot** observe opponents’ rewards but **can** observe their actions, and you want faster convergence or exploitability advantages. |
| **4** | **Policy‑Gradient and Actor‑Critic Methods**            | Treat each agent’s policy parameters directly as the object of optimisation and ascend the expected‑return surface. Convergence is improved by adapting the learning rate (e.g., “Win‑or‑Learn‑Fast”).                         | IGA, WoLF‑IGA, WoLF‑PHC, multi‑agent actor‑critic baselines                              | Continuous action spaces or cases where mixed equilibria are essential and Q‑tables become impractical.                                                                 |
| **5** | **No‑Regret / Online Convex Optimisation Algorithms**   | Update policies so that *average regret* goes to zero; guarantees that the empirical distribution of play converges to the correlated‑equilibrium set under minimal assumptions.                                               | Regret‑Matching, Multiplicative‑Weights (MWU), GIGA / Online Mirror Descent              | Large‑population or high‑action‑count settings where computing any single equilibrium is intractable but correlated‑equilibrium behaviour is sufficient.                |

---

**How the families relate**

* Families 1 & 2 share the same *value‑function* perspective; Family 1 plans with a known model, while Family 2 *learns* that value function from data.
* Families 3 & 4 relax the requirement that Q‑tables identify the right mixed strategy, instead working with *opponent models* (Family 3) or *direct policy parameters* (Family 4).
* Family 5 drops equilibrium computation entirely—if every agent’s regret tends to zero, the time‑averaged joint play converges to a correlated equilibrium automatically.

Together these five classes form the **foundational “toolbox”** on which modern deep‑MARL variants build (e.g., QMIX extends Joint‑Action Learning with neural value‑decomposition; MADDPG adapts actor‑critic ideas; LOLA adds differentiable regret). Understanding the assumptions and guarantees of each family lets you match the right algorithm to the information structure and strategic demands of any new multi‑agent problem.

### “Foundational‑algorithm” families highlighted in Chapter 6

| #                                                                                      | Family (chapter section)                                                                                                                              | Defining idea                                                 | Typical algorithms called‑out by the authors                                                                     | Key assumptions / when to use |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **1. Dynamic‑programming for stochastic games** (§ 6.1)                                | Extend Bellman value‑iteration to *multi‑agent* settings: at every backup, solve the single‑state game (minimax, Nash, etc.) instead of a scalar max. | Shapley value‑iteration (Alg. 6)                              | Full, tabular model of dynamics & rewards for **all** players; small state/action spaces.                        |                               |
| **2. Value‑based Joint‑Action Learning (JAL‑GT)** (§ 6.2)                              | Learn **Q(s,a₁,…,aₙ)** from experience and plug a game‑solver (minimax‑Q, Nash‑Q, Correlated‑Q) into every TD update/greedy step.                     | Minimax‑Q, Nash‑Q, Friend‑or‑Foe Q‑learning (Alg. 7)          | Observe joint action & each agent’s reward; need to agree on an equilibrium concept.                             |                               |
| **3. Agent‑Modelling Joint‑Action Learning (JAL‑AM) / Best‑response learners** (§ 6.3) | Build explicit probabilistic models of other agents’ policies; act (and bootstrap targets) using best‑response or Value‑of‑Information planning.      | Fictitious Play, empirical‑model JAL‑AM, Bayesian VI planners | Cannot see opponents’ rewards, but can see their actions; useful when exploiting structure or reducing variance. |                               |
| **4. Policy‑based / Gradient methods** (§ 6.4)                                         | Treat policy parameters as decision variables; ascend expected return directly. Convergence improved by adaptive rates (WoLF).                        | IGA, WoLF‑IGA, WoLF‑PHC, multi‑agent actor‑critic precursors  | Continuous actions or mixed‑strategy equilibria; do **not** require storing the full joint Q‑table.              |                               |
| **5. No‑regret (online convex‑optimisation) learners** (§ 6.5)                         | Update so that average regret → 0; empirical play provably approaches the correlated‑equilibrium set under minimal structure.                         | Un/Conditional Regret‑Matching, GIGA / Mirror‑Descent         | Very large action spaces or many agents; only need own pay‑offs and realised actions.                            |                               |

#### How the chapter positions them

*The introduction* promises “four classes” (JAL, agent modelling, policy‑based, regret matching) , but the **summary** explicitly adds value‑iteration as a foundational precursor, giving five bullet points .
Taken together, these five families form the conceptual bridge from single‑agent RL to strategic multi‑agent learning: value‑iteration supplies the planning baseline; JAL‑GT adds game‑theoretic backups; agent‑modelling relaxes reward observability; policy‑gradients bypass Q‑tables; and no‑regret dynamics guarantee distributional convergence when equilibrium computation is infeasible.

Understanding which information is available (model vs. samples, opponent rewards vs. only actions) and which solution concept is adequate (minimax, Nash, correlated) lets practitioners pick the right family for a new MARL problem.

## Revised End‑to‑End Checklist

*(explicitly integrates convergence definitions **and** the two single‑agent reduction strategies)*

Work through the sections **in order**.  Each item is phrased as a Yes/No checkpoint; if your answer is **No** you must revise earlier decisions before moving forward.

---

### **0  Prerequisite: record the givens**

* **0‑A.** **Game model (GM)** fixed and written down (state, observations, actions, reward structure, horizon).
* **0‑B.** **Solution concept (SC)** selected (Nash, correlated, minimax …).

*(The remainder of the checklist narrows everything else so that GM + SC become feasible and testable.)*

---

### **1  Augment SC with quantitative / normative tags**

| Tag                                                                 | Tick when settled                                                               | Guidance |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **1‑A ε‑tolerance**: \_\_\_ ≤  (value)                              | Pick the largest ε your application tolerates; smaller ε → more data & compute. |          |
| **1‑B Pareto filter?** □ yes □ no                                   | Requires common reward or scalarisation of rewards.                             |          |
| **1‑C Welfare / fairness criterion?** □ yes □ no                    | Specify metric (Σ‑reward, Jain index …).                                        |          |
| **1‑D Learning‑time horizon (Tmax)**: \_\_\_ (steps / wall‑clock)   | If finite‑time, all guarantees must be stated “within T”.                       |          |
| **1‑E Compute caveat**: GPU \_\_\_, RAM \_\_\_ GB, CPU \_\_\_ cores | Hard resource limits later gate algorithm choice.                               |          |

---

### **2  Choose the single‑agent reduction strategy**

| Choice                                                                                       | Tick one | Feasibility gates                                            |   |                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | - | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2‑A Central‑Learning (CL)** – 1 “super‑agent” controls **joint** action                    | □        | Only if                                                      | A |  = ∏\|A\_i\| fits memory & compute; rewards must already be scalar. |
| **2‑B Independent‑Learning (IL)** – each agent runs its own RL, treats others as environment | □        | Accepts non‑stationarity; expect weaker convergence metrics. |   |                                                                     |
| **2‑C Factorised / CTDE** – central critic + per‑agent actors                                | □        | Hybrid; still bounded by critic size + communication cost.   |   |                                                                     |

> **Stop here if none of the three boxes can be ticked**—you must simplify GM (state or action abstraction) or relax tags (larger ε, remove Pareto/Fairness).

---

### **3  Lock the convergence definition you will claim**

Tick **one** primary metric and, if needed, a secondary monitor.

| Convergence type                                     | Primary metric implemented? | Typical pairing                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **3‑A Policy fixation** (Eq. 5.3)                    | □                           | CL on small games; exact Nash/minimax.          |
| **3‑B Expected‑value convergence** (Eq. 5.4)         | □                           | Policy‑gradient IL baselines.                   |
| **3‑C Empirical‑distribution convergence** (Eq. 5.5) | □                           | Fictitious play; regret‑matching.               |
| **3‑D External/Swap regret → (C)CE**                 | □                           | No‑regret learners, CFR.                        |
| **3‑E Exploitability / best‑response gap**           | □                           | Two‑player zero‑sum, poker solvers.             |
| **3‑F Average return plateaus** (Eq. 5.8)            | □                           | Large‑scale deep RL when others are infeasible. |

  **3‑G.** Target threshold: metric ≤ \_\_\_ (aligns with ε).
  **3‑H.** Evaluation cadence & window defined (e.g., every 10 k env steps, avg over 5 runs).

---

### **4  Derive the data schema**

* **4‑A.** List exact tensors to log *(state / obs, actions, rewards, timestamps, opponent actions if needed for regret or exploitability)*.
* **4‑B.** Storage estimate \_\_\_ GB/day **≤** RAM/SSD budget? □ yes □ no
* **4‑C.** Separate evaluation buffer or opponent pool reserved? □

---

### **5  Filter algorithm candidates**

1. **5‑A.** Match GM & SC to families:

   * Zero‑sum ⇒ {Minimax‑Q, CFR+, AlphaZero‑style self‑play}
   * Common‑reward ⇒ {CQL, QMIX, VDN}
   * General‑sum ⇒ {PSRO, REGRET‑matching, Nash‑Q}
2. **5‑B.** Eliminate algorithms incompatible with reduction choice (row 2).
3. **5‑C.** Eliminate algorithms lacking theoretical or empirical evidence for the convergence type (row 3).
4. **5‑D.** For remaining algorithms, compute rough sample‑complexity/time; **must fit ε and Tmax** (rows 1‑A, 1‑D). If none fit ⇒ enlarge ε, extend Tmax, or simplify GM.

---

### **6  Feasibility sanity‑checks**

| Test                                                           | Pass criteria | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| **6‑A Joint‑action table size** (< 10⁶ entries for tabular CL) | □ pass        |        |
| **6‑B Replay / trajectory RAM** (< 80 % available)             | □ pass        |        |
| **6‑C Wall‑clock training estimate** (< Tmax)                  | □ pass        |        |
| **6‑D GPU memory for model** (< budget)                        | □ pass        |        |

Any failure ⇒ loop back to rows 1 or 2 to relax tags or switch reduction.

---

### **7  Stop‑condition & success declaration**

* **7‑A.** Stop rule: metric from row 3 stays ≤ threshold for \_\_\_ consecutive evaluations **or** training hits Tmax.
* **7‑B.** Success artefacts to save: final policies, evaluation logs, seeds.
* **7‑C.** If stop rule unmet → pre‑registered fallback: increase training budget □ / relax ε □ / switch algorithm □.

---

### **8  Documentation & peer review**

* **8‑A.** Causal DAG updated with any changes; arrows justified.
* **8‑B.** Checklist rows 0–7 signed off by second reviewer.
* **8‑C.** Freeze configuration (code commit + hyper‑grid) before running main experiments.

---

### **Legend (links to the DAG)**

* Tags **ε, PF, WF, LT, CC** originate in **row 1**.
* Single‑agent reduction decision (**row 2**) sits on **GM → ALG** and **CC → ALG** edges.
* Convergence choice (**row 3**) flows from **SC/ε → LG/EM**.
* Data schema (**row 4**) and feasibility tests (**row 6**) embody **DS → ALG** and **CC → DS** edges.
* Algorithm selection (**row 5**) is the intersection node **ALG**, receiving arrows from GM, SC, ε, PF/WF, LT, CC.

---

### **How to use**

1. Print the checklist or embed it in your project tracker.
2. Work top‑to‑bottom; do **not** skip rows.
3. When a test fails, move **upward** to the first row that can plausibly change and iterate.
4. Archive the filled‑in sheet with your experiment code for reproducibility.

Following this expanded checklist guarantees that **convergence criteria** and the **central‑vs‑independent reduction choice** are no longer implicit—they are explicit gatekeepers that must be satisfied before resources are spent on training.

---

Below is a **patch‑style “diff”** that shows (A) **where** to insert new checkpoints and (B) **exact wording** to broaden the checklist so it *explicitly* covers the specialised MARL families introduced in Chapter 6 (Joint‑Action Learning, Agent‑Modelling, Policy‑Gradient, No‑Regret, and Dynamic‑Programming) **plus** the most common deep‑MARL descendants that practitioners reach for in modern work (value‑decomposition, CTDE actor–critic, population‑based / meta‑game methods, mean‑field & graph variants, communication‑learning, credit‑assignment helpers).
Feel free to copy‑paste the shaded blocks into your master checklist.

## 1 Insert a taxonomy banner **above Row 2**

> **📌 NEW   Algorithm Family Selector (AFS)**
> Before you decide on a single‑agent reduction (Row 2), *classify* the game into one of the seven canonical MARL families. **Tick *exactly one***; if none fits, simplify the game or split it into sub‑tasks.

*Rationale*: Chapter 6 shows that **algorithm choice is mostly conditional on the information pattern and solution concept**. The banner forces you to label the problem before you start eliminating algorithms later.

## 2 Expand **Row 2  Single‑Agent Reduction Strategy**

Add two more boxes and a quick guard‑rail:

| Choice                                                                                                              | Tick one | Feasibility gates                                                                                                          |   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| **2‑D Value‑Decomposition (VD)** – CTDE training, *per‑agent* execution with additive or monotonic mixing network   | □        | Requires identical reward for all agents (or shaped shared reward); mixing function must satisfy factorisation assumption. |   |
| **2‑E Mean‑Field / Graph Abstraction (MF/GNN)** – each agent approximates others by distribution or message‑passing | □        | Population ≥ 10 agents *and* either symmetric interactions or an explicit communication channel.                           |   |

> **Fail‑fast rule**: if VD or MF/GNN is selected **but** their gating conditions are not met → fall back to CL / CTDE or redesign reward shaping.

## 3 Add a **credit‑assignment checkpoint** after Row 3

## 4 Extend **Row 3  Convergence Definitions** with two extra monitors

| Convergence type                                                      | Primary metric implemented? | Typical pairing             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **3‑G Population Mean‑Field Fixed‑Point**                             | □                           | Mean‑Field‑Q, Mean‑Field‑AC |
| **3‑H Communication Emergence Score** (mutual‑info / discrete‑syntax) | □                           | DIAL, IC3Net, CommNet       |

## 5 Refactor **Row 5  Filter Algorithm Candidates** – replace 5‑A table with a two‑step funnel

> **5‑A‑1. Map AF tag → canonical families**
>
> * AF‑1 ⇒ {Shapley‑VI, SG‑PI}
> * AF‑2 ⇒ {Minimax‑Q, Nash‑Q, Friend‑or‑Foe Q}
> * AF‑3 ⇒ {JAL‑AM, Fictitious‑Play‑RL, Bayesian‑VI}
> * AF‑4 ⇒ {IGA, WoLF‑PHC, MADDPG, IPPO, COMA}
> * AF‑5 ⇒ {Regret‑Matching, GIGA, CFR(+)}
> * AF‑6 ⇒ {VDN, QMIX, QTRAN, QPLEX, QPER, LIIR}
> * AF‑7 ⇒ {Mean‑Field‑Q, Mean‑Field‑AC, Graph‑AC, DIAL, IC3Net, CommNet}
>
> **5‑A‑2. Cross‑check reduction**
> Remove any algorithm that contradicts the ticked box in Row 2 (e.g., VD algorithms need 2‑D; MADDPG demands CTDE box; CFR needs CL or perfect recall logs).

---

## 6 Add **Row 7‑D Safety & Social‑welfare audit**

> **7‑D Safety / side‑effect metrics satisfied?** □ Robustness‑gap ≤ … □ Energy use ≤ …

---

## 7 Insert **Row 9  Population‑level Diagnostics** (optional but recommended for AF‑5 & AF‑7)

| Diagnostic                           | Implemented? | Comment                              |

### Summary of what changed & why

| Checklist Part                   | Change                      | Chapter 6 motivation                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algorithm‑Family Selector**    | Adds AF‑1…AF‑7 banner       | Sec 6.1‑6.5 classify algorithms primarily by *assumptions* and *information pattern*.                                           |
| **Row 2**                        | Adds VD & MF/GNN reductions | Value‑decomposition and mean‑field methods are the two most common *scalable* specialisations not captured by CL/IL/CTDE alone. |
| **Credit‑assignment checkpoint** | New Row 3‑I                 | Chapter 6 highlights how difference‑rewards (or Shapley) stabilise learning in cooperative games.                               |
| **Extra convergence metrics**    | 3‑G, 3‑H                    | Mean‑field fixed points & emergent communication are distinct success notions for AF‑7.                                         |
| **Refined algorithm funnel**     | Row 5 split                 | Prevents accidental mix‑and‑match of incompatible assumptions.                                                                  |
| **Safety audit**                 | Row 7‑D                     | Policy‑gradient & regret learners can explore unsafe actions—explicit audit closes the loop.                                    |
| **Population diagnostics**       | Row 9                       | Empirical‑distribution metrics are the *guarantee* for no‑regret and population‑based training.                                 |

The checklist now **covers every major specialised MARL family** that Chapter 6 (and its deep‑learning successors) put in the practitioner’s toolbox, while keeping the original top‑to‑bottom gating logic intact.
