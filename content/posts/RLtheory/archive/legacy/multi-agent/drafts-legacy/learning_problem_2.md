# A Practical Checklist for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

This checklist provides a structured, end-to-end framework for designing, implementing, and evaluating MARL systems. It synthesizes foundational principles with modern deep-learning approaches to guide practitioners from problem definition to deployment.

---

## Phase 1: Problem Definition & Constraints

First, establish the foundational elements of the multi-agent environment and the project's practical limitations.

### **1.1 Core Problem Setup**
- [ ] **Game Model (GM) Documented:** Define the state space, observation model for each agent, action spaces, reward structure (individual and/or team), and the episode horizon.
- [ ] **Solution Concept (SC) Chosen:** Specify the target equilibrium or behavioral outcome (e.g., Nash Equilibrium, Correlated Equilibrium, Minimax/Maximin, Social Optimum).
- [ ] **Problem Type Identified:**
    - [ ] **Cooperative:** Agents share a common reward signal.
    - [ ] **Competitive:** A zero-sum or constant-sum game.
    - [ ] **Mixed-Motive:** A general-sum game with elements of both cooperation and competition.
    - [ ] **Coordination:** Multiple desirable equilibria exist, and agents must agree on one.

### **1.2 Performance & Resource Requirements**
- [ ] **Convergence Tolerance (`ε`):** Define the acceptable margin of error for your chosen metrics.
- [ ] **Training Budget:** Set a hard limit on training time (e.g., environment steps, wall-clock hours).
- [ ] **Success Threshold:** State the specific, measurable metric value that defines a successful outcome.
- [ ] **Evaluation Cadence:** Determine how often to evaluate policies and over how many runs to average results.
- [ ] **Compute & Storage Budget:** Note the available hardware (GPUs, RAM, CPUs) and storage for data logs and model checkpoints.

## Phase 2: Algorithm & Architecture Selection

Based on the problem definition, select an appropriate family of algorithms and a learning architecture.

### **2.1 Algorithm Family Selection**

Choose the family whose assumptions best align with your problem's information structure.

| Family | Core Idea & When to Use | Representative Algorithms | Key Information Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Programming** | **Plan with a full model.** Use when the complete game dynamics and all reward functions are known. | Shapley Value Iteration | Full model of dynamics & rewards for all agents. |
| **Joint-Action Learning** | **Learn a joint value function.** For small, fully observable games requiring game-theoretic solutions. | Minimax-Q, Nash-Q, Correlated-Q | Must observe the joint action and all rewards. |
| **Agent Modelling** | **Learn and exploit opponent models.** When you can observe others' actions but not their rewards. | Fictitious Play, JAL-AM | Can observe actions, but not others' rewards. |
| **Policy Gradient** | **Directly optimise policies.** Essential for large or continuous action spaces. Often uses CTDE. | MADDPG, COMA, IPPO | Agent's own observations and actions. |
| **Value Decomposition** | **Factorise a team value function.** For fully cooperative settings to enable credit assignment. | VDN, QMIX, QTRAN | A single, shared team reward signal. |
| **No-Regret Learning** | **Guarantee convergence in the limit.** For large populations or when computing an exact equilibrium is intractable. | Regret Matching, CFR | Only requires an agent's own realised payoffs. |
| **Mean-Field / Graph** | **Approximate interactions in large populations.** For problems with many similar, symmetric agents. | Mean-Field-Q, Graph-AC | Access to population statistics or an interaction graph. |
| **Communication Learning**| **Learn to communicate effectively.** For partially observable problems where explicit coordination is beneficial. | DIAL, IC3Net, CommNet | A communication channel between agents. |

### **2.2 Learning Architecture**

Choose the fundamental training paradigm.

- [ ] **Centralised Learning (CL):** A single "super-agent" learns a joint policy for all agents.
- [ ] **Independent Learning (IL):** Each agent learns its own policy, treating other agents as part of the environment.
- [ ] **Centralised Training with Decentralised Execution (CTDE):** Agents use extra information during training (e.g., a shared critic) but act independently during execution.
- [ ] **Value Decomposition (VD):** A specialised form of CTDE for cooperative games where a central critic learns a factorised team value function.
- [ ] **Mean-Field (MF):** Each agent learns against the average behaviour of the population rather than modelling each opponent individually.

---

## Phase 3: Convergence & Evaluation Design

Define precisely how you will measure success and monitor progress.

### **3.1 Primary Convergence Metric**

Select **one** primary metric that aligns with your chosen solution concept.

- [ ] **Policy/Value Convergence:** The change in policy parameters or value estimates falls below a threshold `ε`.
- [ ] **Empirical Distribution Convergence:** The distribution of play (i.e., how often actions are chosen) stabilises.
- [ ] **Regret Bound:** The average regret per time step approaches zero.
- [ ] **Exploitability:** The best-response value against the current policy is close to the policy's actual value (standard for two-player, zero-sum games).
- [ ] **Performance Plateau:** The average reward stops improving over a sustained period.

### **3.2 Secondary Monitoring Metrics**
- [ ] **Training Stability:** Track loss curves and gradient norms to diagnose issues.
- [ ] **Behavioural Diversity:** Measure the entropy of policies to monitor exploration and strategic variety.
- [ ] **Communication Efficiency:** For communication-learning agents, track message sparsity or information content.
- [ ] **Robustness:** Evaluate performance against a pool of fixed, diverse opponents.
- [ ] **Social Welfare Metrics:** Track efficiency (sum of rewards) and equity (fairness of reward distribution).

---

## Phase 4: Implementation & Experimentation

Translate the design into a concrete implementation and experimental protocol.

### **4.1 Implementation Plan**
- [ ] **Data Schema:** Define the exact tensors to be logged (states, observations, actions, rewards, messages).
- [ ] **Feasibility Checks:** Verify that memory requirements (replay buffer, model size) and computational load (training throughput) are within budget.
- [ ] **Algorithm Configuration:** Specify the hyperparameter grid, exploration strategy, update rules, and any regularization techniques.
- [ ] **Baseline Comparisons:** Select appropriate baselines for comparison (e.g., random policy, independent learners, state-of-the-art).

### **4.2 Experimental Protocol**
- [ ] **Evaluation Environments:** Define separate training, validation, and held-out test environments.
- [ ] **Statistical Rigor:** Plan to use multiple random seeds and report confidence intervals or significance tests.
- [ ] **Stopping Criteria:** Set a clear rule for when to stop training (e.g., primary metric is met, or budget is exhausted).
- [ ] **Reproducibility:** Archive all code, configurations, seeds, and dependencies.

## Phase 5: Safety, Auditing & Deployment

Before and after the main experiments, address robustness, social impact, and scalability.

### **5.1 Safety & Social Audit**
- [ ] **Robustness Testing:** Evaluate how performance degrades under adversarial opponents, distribution shift, or agent failures.
- [ ] **Fairness & Equity:** Analyse the distribution of rewards and ensure no agent is unfairly exploited or starved.
- [ ] **Interpretability:** Assess whether the learned behaviours are understandable and whether any unintended side effects have emerged.

### **5.2 Deployment & Monitoring**
- [ ] **Scalability:** Consider how the system will perform as the number of agents grows.
- [ ] **Monitoring Plan:** Define key performance indicators to track in a live environment.
- [ ] **Maintenance Strategy:** Plan for model updates, drift detection, and graceful degradation in case of failure.
- [ ] **Human Oversight:** Establish protocols for when and how a human operator should intervene.




## Can we learn game solutions instead of computing them from a model?


## If each agent just treats the others as part of the environment, what goes wrong?


## Which equilibrium concept should we shoot for?


## Can one generic template cover all these algorithms?



## Is modelling opponents better than worst‑case assumptions?



## How much is it worth to probe another agent?



## Why won’t plain gradient ascent just settle?


## What if equilibrium requires randomising?


## Could a single learning rule guarantee ‘no regrets’ regardless of opponents?


## Is there an algorithm that converges to equilibrium in every general‑sum stochastic game?
