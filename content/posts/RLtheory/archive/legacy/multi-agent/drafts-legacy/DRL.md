1. **What information can agents use to make their action selection, that is, to condition their policy on?**
2. **How might we provide agents with more explicit information about the policies of other agents?**
3. **How can agents leverage the fact that other agents are learning by shaping their behaviour to their own advantage?**
4. **Given these considerations, why would we want to train action‑value critics for multi‑agent actor‑critic algorithms, instead of learning simpler critics?**
5. **In this section, we will discuss how agents can efficiently learn and use individual utility functions to jointly approximate the centralised action‑value function…?**
6. **Which reward would agent *i* have received if it instead had selected its default action?**
