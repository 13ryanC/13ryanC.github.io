1. **Which properties and learning abilities do we want to test in a MARL algorithm?**
2. **Can the algorithm reliably converge to the desired solution concept on this task?**
3. **How well does the algorithm scale with the number of agents?**
4. **Is the state/action space sufficiently rich (or purposely minimal) for the question we care about?**
5. **What level of observability should agents have?**
6. **How dense or sparse is the reward signal—and is that desirable?**
7. **Which high‑level skills (co‑operation, communication, role allocation, etc.) does the environment demand?**
8. **Does the environment offer a scalable ladder of task variants? (agent count, map size, observability radius, etc.)**
9. **Will this benchmark expose generalisation rather than over‑fitting?**
10. **Are ground‑truth solutions available or at least testable?**
11. **Do we have the practical resources (software, compute, licences) to run this environment at scale?**
