The mathematical problem or game discussed, and for which a poll was conducted, is known as the **St. Petersburg paradox**.

Here's a breakdown of the game and the subsequent discussion:

**The Game (St. Petersburg Paradox)**:
*   **Setup**: The game involves flipping a fair coin.
*   **Objective**: A player pays an upfront fixed cost to participate.
*   **Rules**:
    *   The coin is flipped repeatedly until a head appears for the first time.
    *   If the first head appears on the 1st flip (k=1), the player receives one dollar (2^(k-1) = 2^0 = 1).
    *   If the first head appears on the 2nd flip (k=2), the player receives two dollars (2^(k-1) = 2^1 = 2).
    *   If the first head appears on the 3rd flip (k=3), the player receives four dollars (2^(k-1) = 2^2 = 4).
    *   In general, if the first head appears on the k-th flip, the player receives 2^(k-1) dollars.
*   **Question Posed**: "How much are you willing to pay for this game to play this game with me?".

**The Poll and Discussion**:
*   **Poll Results**: The instructor started a poll with several ranges for the amount people would be willing to pay. Out of 15 votes:
    *   Less than one dollar: 3 votes
    *   One to two dollars: 3 votes
    *   Two to four dollars: 2 votes
    *   Four to hundred dollars: 2 votes
    *   Hundred plus dollars: 7 votes
*   **Reasoning for Low Payments**: Some participants who voted for lower amounts (e.g., "less than one") adopted a **worst-case analysis** or were risk-averse, focusing on the high probability of losing in the very first few flips.
*   **Reasoning for High Payments**: A participant who voted for "hundred plus" reasoned that since the **expected reward is infinity**, one can "never pay too much".
*   **The Paradox Explained**: The instructor highlights that the **expected value** of this game is indeed **infinite**. This is calculated by summing the product of the probability of winning (1/2^k for a head on the k-th trial) and the reward (2^(k-1)) for all possible k from 1 to infinity. The (1/2^k) * (2^(k-1)) term simplifies to 1/2, and summing this for all k leads to an infinite value.
*   **Key Insight**: The paradox illustrates that **just going for the expected return may not be the best thing**. Despite an infinite expected value, people are generally unwilling to pay a very large amount, as the distribution of returns is "very skewed," with a very small probability of very large rewards. This suggests that **risk** must be taken into account, not just the expected value.
*   **Connection to MDPs**: This paradox serves as an example of why the **undiscounted case** in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is "quite delicate". In such cases, values or returns might be infinite (positive or negative), posing challenges to defining and working with these problems. The lecturer notes that in discounted MDPs, rewards are bounded, ensuring finite total rewards and well-defined expectations, unlike the St. Petersburg paradox where immediate rewards are unbounded. For undiscounted cases, additional conditions (like having "goal states" that are reachable with positive probability and non-negative costs) are often needed for the fundamental theorem to hold and for values to be well-defined.



The mathematical problem (or game) being discussed is the **St. Petersburg paradox**.

Here's the mathematics behind it:

*   **The Game Setup**:
    *   A fair coin is flipped repeatedly.
    *   The game continues until a head appears for the first time.
    *   The **payout** is determined by which flip (\(k\)) the first head appears on:
        *   If the first head is on the 1st flip (\(k=1\)), the player receives **\(1** (which is \)2^{1-1}\( or \)2^0$).
        *   If the first head is on the 2nd flip (\(k=2\)), the player receives **\(2** (which is \)2^{2-1}\( or \)2^1$).
        *   If the first head is on the 3rd flip (\(k=3\)), the player receives **\(4** (which is \)2^{3-1}\( or \)2^2$).
        *   In general, if the first head appears on the \(k\)-th flip, the player receives **\(2^{k-1}\) dollars**.

*   **Calculating the Expected Value**:
    *   The **probability** of the first head appearing on the \(k\)-th flip (meaning \(k-1\) tails followed by one head) is \((1/2)^k\) or \(1/2^k\). This is because each flip is independent, and the probability of a tail is \(1/2\) and a head is \(1/2\).
    *   The **expected reward** for each possible outcome (\(k\)) is the probability of that outcome multiplied by its corresponding reward.
    *   To find the **total expected value** (E) of the game, you sum the expected reward for all possible values of \(k\) from 1 to infinity:
        $$ E = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \text{Probability of head on k-th flip} \times \text{Reward for head on k-th flip} \right) $$
        $$ E = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2^k} \times 2^{k-1} \right) $$
    *   Let's simplify the term inside the summation:
        $$ \frac{1}{2^k} \times 2^{k-1} = \frac{1}{2^k} \times \frac{2^k}{2^1} = \frac{1}{2} $$
    *   So, the summation becomes:
        $$ E = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2} $$
    *   This is an infinite sum of \(1/2\), which means the **expected value of the game is infinity**.

*   **The Paradox and Discussion**:
    *   Despite the mathematical expectation of an infinite return, people are generally **unwilling to pay a very large amount** (e.g., millions or billions of dollars) to play this game.
    *   The poll results reflected this: while 7 out of 15 votes were for "hundred plus" dollars, indicating some consideration for the high potential, other significant portions voted for much lower amounts like "less than one dollar" or "one to two dollars".
    *   Those who voted for lower amounts often adopted a **worst-case analysis** or were **risk-averse**, focusing on the high probability of the game ending quickly with a small payout. For instance, there's a 50% chance of getting only \(1 on the first flip, and a 75% chance of getting \)2 or less within the first two flips.
    *   The paradox highlights that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"**. The distribution of returns is "very skewed," meaning there's a "very small probability of very large rewards". This implies that **risk** must be taken into account alongside expected value.
    *   This scenario serves as an example of why the **undiscounted case** in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be "quite delicate". In undiscounted MDPs, values or returns might be infinite (positive or negative), making them challenging to define and work with. Unlike the discounted case where rewards are bounded (ensuring finite total rewards and well-defined expectations), the St. Petersburg paradox demonstrates a situation where immediate rewards are unbounded, leading to an infinite expected value. For the undiscounted case to be well-behaved, additional conditions, such as having "goal states" reachable with positive probability and non-negative costs, are often necessary for the fundamental theorem to hold and for values to be well-defined.


The concept of "expectations," particularly in the context of mathematical problems or games, refers to the **expected value** or **expected reward**. This is a weighted average of all possible outcomes, where each outcome's value is weighted by its probability of occurring. The discussion in the sources highlights two scenarios regarding expected values: when they are large (specifically, infinite) and when they are finite (or "small" in comparison to infinity).

Here's an explanation of both:

### When Expectations Are Large (Infinite)

The primary example of a large, specifically infinite, expectation is illustrated by the **St. Petersburg paradox**.

*   **The Game Setup**: In this game, a fair coin is flipped repeatedly until a head appears for the first time. If the first head appears on the \(k\)-th flip, the player receives \(2^{k-1}\) dollars. For instance, a head on the 1st flip yields \(1, on the 2nd flip \)2, on the 3rd flip $4, and so on.
*   **Calculating Infinite Expectation**: The probability of the first head appearing on the \(k\)-th flip is \(1/2^k\). The expected reward for each \(k\) is \((1/2^k) \times 2^{k-1}\), which simplifies to \(1/2\). Summing this value (\(1/2\)) for all possible \(k\) from 1 to infinity results in an **infinite expected value**.
*   **The Paradox**: Despite this mathematically infinite expected reward, most people are **unwilling to pay a very large amount** (e.g., millions or billions of dollars) to play the game.
    *   **Poll Results**: A poll conducted showed varied responses, with some participants willing to pay "less than one dollar" or "one to two dollars" due to a **worst-case analysis** or risk aversion, fearing the high probability of the game ending quickly with a small payout. Others, noting the infinite expected value, were willing to pay "hundred plus dollars," reasoning that one can "never pay too much" if the expected reward is infinity.
    *   **Key Insight**: The paradox demonstrates that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"**. The distribution of returns is "very skewed," meaning there's a "very small probability of very large rewards". This highlights that **risk** must be factored into decision-making, not just the expected value.
*   **Connection to Undiscounted MDPs**: This paradox exemplifies why the **undiscounted case** in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is "quite delicate". In such scenarios, values or returns can be infinite (either positive or negative), making them challenging to define and work with. The sources explain that when there are "infinite expectations," things are "really not valid" in terms of what one can do with such a problem, often necessitating a reformulation.

### When Expectations Are Finite (or "Small")

In contrast to the St. Petersburg paradox, expected values are often finite, particularly in well-behaved models like **discounted MDPs**.

*   **Discounted MDPs**: The fundamental theorem for MDPs, as discussed in the lecture, is primarily stated and proven for the **discounted case**. In this setting, future rewards are discounted by a factor (gamma), ensuring that the total sum of rewards over an infinite horizon remains finite.
*   **Bounded Rewards/Costs**: A crucial reason for finite expectations in the discounted case is that if you have **finitely many states and actions**, the immediate rewards (or costs) are **bounded**. This boundedness ensures that the total reward over an infinite horizon is also within a bounded range, making all expectations well-defined and finite.
*   **Infinitely Many States/Actions**: Even with infinitely many states and actions, if the **reward or cost is assumed to be bounded**, then all expectations can still be finite and well-defined. However, if rewards or costs can grow unbounded in infinite state spaces (e.g., in LQR problems where cost penalizes deviation from zero, and state deviation can be unbounded), then the expectation can again become infinite, making the problem "delicate".
*   **Implications for MDP Theory**: The "nicest thing about the discounted case is that well if you have finitely many states and actions no further conditions are needed" for the fundamental theorem to hold. This makes the theory for discounted MDPs "super nice" and relatively easier to prove. For undiscounted cases where infinite expectations might arise, additional conditions (like the presence of "goal states" reachable with positive probability, and non-negative costs) are often required for values to be well-defined and for fundamental theorems to apply meaningfully.

In summary, whether expectations are large (infinite) or finite profoundly impacts the tractability and practical interpretation of mathematical problems, particularly in areas like reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes. Finite expectations, often guaranteed by discounting or bounded rewards/costs, lead to well-behaved theoretical frameworks, while infinite expectations necessitate a re-evaluation of problem definitions and practical decision-making strategies.


The behavior of expected return varies significantly depending on whether the rewards are unbounded, leading to **large (infinite) expectations**, or bounded, leading to **finite expectations**.

### When Expected Return is Large (Infinite)

The most prominent example of a large, specifically **infinite, expected return** is demonstrated by the **St. Petersburg paradox**.

*   **The Game**: In this game, a fair coin is flipped repeatedly until a head appears for the first time. If the first head appears on the \(k\)-th flip, the player receives a payout of \(2^{k-1}\) dollars. For instance, a head on the first flip yields \(1, on the second flip \)2, on the third flip $4, and so on.
*   **Infinite Expectation Calculation**: The probability of the first head appearing on the \(k\)-th flip is \(1/2^k\). The expected reward for each \(k\) is calculated by multiplying this probability by the reward: \((1/2^k) \times 2^{k-1}\), which simplifies to \(1/2\). When you sum this value (\(1/2\)) for all possible \(k\) from 1 to infinity, the **total expected value of the game is infinite**.
*   **The Paradox and its Implications**: Despite this mathematically infinite expected reward, people are generally **unwilling to pay a very large amount** (e.g., millions or billions of dollars) to play this game.
    *   A poll conducted on this very question revealed varied responses: some participants voted for "less than one dollar" or "one to two dollars," often driven by a **worst-case analysis** or **risk aversion**, given the high probability of the game ending quickly with a small payout. For example, there's a 50% chance of getting only $1 on the first flip.
    *   Conversely, those who voted for "hundred plus" amounts reasoned that if the expected reward is infinity, "you can never pay too much".
    *   The paradox highlights that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"**. The distribution of returns is "very skewed," meaning there's a "very small probability of very large rewards". This implies that **risk must be taken into account** alongside the expected value when making decisions.
*   **Connection to Undiscounted MDPs**: This scenario illustrates why the **undiscounted case** in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be "quite delicate". When there are "infinite expectations," mathematical models can become problematic, and "things are really not valid" in terms of how one can define and use such a problem. This often necessitates reformulating problems to ensure values are well-defined.

### When Expected Return is Finite (or "Small")

In contrast to the St. Petersburg paradox, expected values are typically **finite and well-defined** in many well-behaved mathematical models, particularly in **discounted MDPs**.

*   **Discounted MDPs**: The fundamental theorem for MDPs, which establishes that the optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, is primarily stated and proven for the **discounted case**. In discounted MDPs, future rewards are scaled down by a discount factor (gamma), ensuring that the total sum of rewards over an infinite horizon remains finite.
*   **Bounded Rewards/Costs**: A key reason for finite expectations in the discounted case is that if you have **finitely many states and actions**, the immediate rewards or costs are inherently **bounded**. This boundedness ensures that the total accumulated reward over an infinite horizon also falls within a finite range, making all expectations "well-defined".
*   **Infinite State/Action Spaces with Bounded Rewards**: Even if you have **infinitely many states and actions**, if the **reward or cost is assumed to be bounded**, then all expectations can still be finite and well-defined.
*   **The "Nicest Thing" about the Discounted Case**: The sources state that the "nicest thing about the discounted case is that well if you have finitely many states and actions no further conditions are needed" for the fundamental theorem to hold. This makes the theory for discounted MDPs "super nice" and relatively easier to prove.
*   **Unbounded Costs in Specific Cases**: It's important to note that even in infinite state spaces, if the "natural choice for the cost of the reward would be that it kind of grows" (e.g., in Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems where cost penalizes deviation from zero, and state deviation can be unbounded), then the expectation can again become infinite, making the problem "delicate". Such unbounded costs are viewed as delicate because while "not real" in the sense of physically infinite, they express that "something's gonna break" if costs get too high.

In summary, the behavior of expected return—whether it's finite or infinitely large—is a crucial aspect of defining and solving problems in mathematical frameworks like MDPs. Finite expectations lead to well-behaved theoretical models, while infinite expectations necessitate careful consideration of risk and often require additional conditions or problem reformulation for meaningful analysis.


Beyond the behavior of expected return with large and small rewards, the lecture delves into several other fundamental concepts and discussions within Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) [i]. These include:

*   **The Fundamental Theorem for MDPs**:
    *   This is highlighted as **the single most important thing to remember** from the first lecture.
    *   It states two key parts:
        1.  **The optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation**. This means that the best possible value you can achieve from any state is consistently defined by an equation that relates it to the optimal values of future states.
        2.  **Any greedy policy with respect to the optimal value function will be an optimal policy**. This implies that once you know the optimal value for each state, simply choosing the action that maximizes the immediate reward plus the discounted optimal value of the next state will lead to the best overall long-term outcome.
    *   The theorem's proof in the lectures is primarily conducted for **finitely many states and actions** and specifically for the **discounted case**.
    *   **Importance**: This theorem is foundational for many reinforcement learning algorithms and is considered "Bellman's big idea" for dynamic programming, breaking down problems into sub-problems and building solutions from them. It also suggests that if you can find the optimal value function, you can then derive an optimal policy.

*   **Optimal Policies: Memoryless and Deterministic**:
    *   A significant insight from the theorem is that **optimal value is achieved by memoryless policies**, and these policies do not need to be history-dependent or non-stationary. This means that to act optimally in an MDP, you **don't need to remember the history** of states or actions; only the current state is sufficient.
    *   This is a "nice feature" and an "important thing to know," simplifying the search for optimal policies because it reduces the potentially uncountably infinite set of all policies to a finite, manageable set of deterministic memoryless policies.
    *   However, the lecture also discusses why the broader class of non-memoryless (history-dependent) policies is still defined: to **investigate if remembering history adds anything** (it doesn't for optimality in standard MDPs), and because **learning algorithms often produce non-stationary policies** that depend on past experiences (e.g., neural network weight updates based on observed history).

*   **Discounted vs. Undiscounted vs. Finite Horizon MDPs**:
    *   The lecture primarily focuses on **discounted MDPs** because they are seen as a good balance between the simpler finite horizon case and the more complex undiscounted or average-cost infinite horizon cases. Discounting future rewards ensures that the **total sum of rewards over an infinite horizon remains finite and well-defined** if rewards are bounded.
    *   **Finite Horizon MDPs** are fundamentally different as optimal actions depend on the time remaining, meaning optimal policies are not stationary. However, the corresponding theorem is "even easier to prove" using backward induction.
    *   The **undiscounted total reward setting** is "quite delicate" because value functions might be infinite (positive or negative). This often requires **additional conditions** for the values to be well-defined and for the fundamental theorem to hold, such as all policies being "proper" (reaching a goal state with positive probability) and all costs being non-negative.
    *   The **average reward setting** is also discussed, particularly its relevance in the control community and in the analysis of online learning algorithms. It has a peculiar aspect where policies might delay good actions indefinitely without hurting the long-term average, which is a conceptual challenge for theorists.

*   **Occupancy Measures**:
    *   **Discounted occupancy measures** represent the "total occupation" or expected discounted number of times a state or state-action pair is visited under a policy.
    *   They are fundamental because they **separate the reward function from the policy and dynamics**. The value function can be expressed as a product of the occupancy measure and the reward function, which is "super useful".
    *   The fact that **memoryless policies can reproduce the same set of state occupancy measures** as more complex history-dependent policies is a key part of the proof that history-dependent policies do not add value.

*   **Reward Function Formulation**:
    *   The lecture uses a minimalist definition where rewards depend on **state-action pairs**.
    *   Other formulations (e.g., depending on state-action-next state, or just next state) are generally **interchangeable** by slight MDP modifications or by "fiddling with the expectations," as long as the reward is **Markovian** (does not depend on history).
    *   However, the speaker notes that when considering **stochastic rewards** (rewards with inherent randomness beyond what's captured by the next state), there can be "strong separation between problems with generally stochastic rewards and deterministic rewards" for which the theory might differ, especially in learning contexts.

*   **Start State Distribution**:
    *   The lecture argues that the fundamental theorem **does not depend on any start state distribution**, and defining MDPs without explicitly including one allows for broader applicability.
    *   While a start state distribution "does exist" over the state space, its usefulness depends on the problem setting. For example, in robotics, where the initial state might not be controllable, it's desirable for a robot to act well "no matter the initial state".
    *   The lecture acknowledges that sometimes a start state distribution is introduced out of "necessity" for certain applications or to make problems more tractable.

*   **Value Iteration Convergence Rate**:
    *   Value iteration, an algorithm used to find the optimal value function, converges at a **geometric rate**.
    *   This means the distance to the optimum decreases exponentially with each iteration. Consequently, the number of iterations needed for the error to fall below a certain epsilon level is **logarithmic in the inverse of the desired accuracy**.

*   **MDP Models as Imperfect Abstractions**:
    *   The lecture emphasizes that MDPs are **mathematical frameworks that model problems** and are inherently "imperfect" abstractions.
    *   For instance, an **infinite horizon** is an abstraction as real-world interactions are finite. However, it's often used because the alternative (finite horizon) requires accounting for remaining time, which complicates the model.
    *   Similarly, **unbounded costs** (where costs can grow infinitely large, e.g., in LQR problems) are seen as "delicate" because they are not "real" in a physical sense, but they express that "something's gonna break" if costs run away. These abstractions simplify the mathematical analysis while still capturing essential aspects of real-world problems.

The lecture aims to provide a robust theoretical foundation for MDPs, primarily focusing on the discounted case due to its mathematical tractability, while acknowledging and discussing the complexities and nuances of other settings and reward function definitions.


The discounted case in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is favored in the lectures due to several advantages and "nice" properties. Here are the key benefits mentioned:

*   **Balance and Simplicity**
    *   Discounted MDPs strike a good **balance between the finite horizon case and the more complex undiscounted or average-cost infinite horizon cases**.
    *   They are "a little bit easier than the other cases" and involve "fewer complications," making them a more tractable starting point for theoretical analysis.

*   **Tractability of the Fundamental Theorem**
    *   The **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs** (which states that the optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, and any greedy policy with respect to it is optimal) is proven for the discounted case, and its proof is described as "not too hard".
    *   A significant advantage is that for **finitely many states and actions, no further conditions are needed** for the fundamental theorem to hold in the discounted case. This contrasts with the undiscounted case, which often requires additional assumptions like all policies being "proper" or all costs being non-negative to ensure well-defined values.

*   **Well-Defined Value Functions**
    *   Unlike the "delicate" undiscounted total reward setting, where value functions can become infinite (positive or negative), the discounted case (especially with finitely many states and actions) ensures that **rewards are bounded, leading to finite and well-defined total rewards and expectations**. This avoids the "weirdness" seen in problems like the St. Petersburg paradox, where the expected return is infinite, yet practical intuition suggests a low willingness to pay.

*   **Stationary and Memoryless Optimal Policies**
    *   The infinite horizon discounted setting naturally has **stationarity "burned into" it**. This is a "nice feature" and "important thing to know" because it implies that **optimal value can be achieved by memoryless policies** that do not depend on past history or the current time step. This drastically simplifies the search for optimal policies, as one only needs to consider a finite set of deterministic memoryless policies.

*   **Utility of Occupancy Measures**
    *   The framework is well-suited to **discounted occupancy measures**, which are considered fundamental because they elegantly separate the reward function from the policy and dynamics. The value function can be expressed as a product of the occupancy measure and the reward function, which is "super useful". Crucially, memoryless policies are capable of generating the same set of state occupancy measures as more complex history-dependent policies, reinforcing their sufficiency for optimality.

*   **Efficient Convergence of Value Iteration**
    *   Value iteration, a key algorithm for finding the optimal value function, **converges at a geometric rate** in the discounted setting. This means that the distance to the optimum decreases exponentially with each iteration, and the number of iterations required to achieve a desired accuracy is **logarithmic in the inverse of that accuracy**, indicating efficient computation.

*   **Compatibility with Infinite State Spaces**
    *   Even when dealing with infinitely many states and actions, if one assumes **bounded rewards or costs**, the discounted case remains "fine". This property is particularly appealing because it simplifies the application of more advanced techniques like function approximation, which are necessary for infinite state spaces and often rely on bounded reward assumptions.

*   **Robustness and Graceful Degradation**
    *   The theoretical results are not "too brittle". This means that even if a value function is only an approximation (close to the optimal value function), the greedy policy derived from it will still be **near-optimal**, demonstrating a **graceful degradation of performance** rather than a sudden breakdown. This is highly practical, as perfect optimality is rarely achievable in real-world scenarios.


Based on the lecture transcript, the discussion around what you refer to as "40:00" focuses on the **St. Petersburg paradox**. This paradox serves as a crucial illustration of why simply relying on **expected return** can be an inadequate measure for decision-making, especially in scenarios where values can become infinite or distributions are highly skewed.

Here's a breakdown of that discussion:

*   **The Game's Setup**:
    *   You're offered a game where a fair coin is flipped repeatedly until a head appears for the first time.
    *   If the first head appears on the *k*-th flip, you receive a reward of \(2^{k-1}\) dollars.
    *   For example:
        *   If the first head is on the 1st flip, you get \(2^{1-1} = \\)1$.
        *   If the first head is on the 2nd flip, you get \(2^{2-1} = \\)2$.
        *   If the first head is on the 3rd flip, you get \(2^{3-1} = \\)4$.
        *   And so on, the reward **doubles with each additional tail** before the first head.

*   **The Central Question**:
    *   The lecturer asks how much a person would be willing to pay upfront to play this game. A poll was conducted, revealing a wide range of willingness to pay, with a notable portion willing to pay $100+.

*   **The Paradoxical Expected Value**:
    *   The **mathematical expected reward** of this game is **infinite**. This is calculated by summing the product of each possible reward and its probability:
        *   The probability of the game ending on the *k*-th trial (i.e., *k*-1 tails followed by a head) is \(1/2^k\).
        *   The reward for this outcome is \(2^{k-1}\).
        *   So, each term in the sum is \((1/2^k) \times (2^{k-1}) = 1/2\).
        *   Summing an infinite number of \(1/2\) terms results in an infinite expected value.

*   **The Discrepancy and Its Lesson**:
    *   Despite the theoretically infinite expected return, most people are **not willing to pay a very large sum** (like a billion dollars) to play the game.
    *   This highlights a critical point: **expectations can work in "unexpected" ways, especially when they are "really large"**.
    *   The main lesson is that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"** in such scenarios. Instead, **risk needs to be taken into account**.
    *   The distribution of returns is "very skewed". This means that while "very large rewards" are theoretically possible, they occur with "very, very small probability". The vast majority of the time, the game will end quickly with a small payout, making the infinite expectation a poor guide for typical outcomes or a reasonable price to pay.

*   **Connection to Undiscounted MDPs**:
    *   The St. Petersburg paradox is used as an example of the "weird stuff" that can happen in the **undiscounted total reward setting** of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In this setting, value functions can become infinite (either positive or negative), making them "quite delicate" and difficult to work with.
    *   This is contrasted with the **discounted case**, which is generally "super nice" because rewards are bounded (especially with finitely many states and actions), ensuring that total rewards and expectations are finite and well-defined, thus avoiding the "weirdness" of infinite values.



You are correct that the discussion at that point in the lecture also touched upon "goal states" (which you refer to as "ghost states"). This concept is introduced as a way to handle the "delicate" nature of the **undiscounted total reward setting** in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a setting where issues like those highlighted by the St. Petersburg paradox can arise.

Here's more about "goal states" and their significance:

*   **Definition and Purpose**: In the undiscounted case, "goal states" are specific states that, once entered, you **stay there indefinitely and receive no further reward or cost**. This mechanism is introduced to ensure that the total accumulated costs or rewards remain finite and well-defined, addressing the problem of potentially infinite value functions that can occur in undiscounted settings.
*   **Stochastic Shortest Path Problems**: When these "goal states" are incorporated, especially in a cost-minimization context where all costs are non-negative, the problem becomes analogous to a **stochastic shortest path problem**. In this type of problem, the objective is to minimize the total expected cost until a goal state is reached.
*   **Enabling the Fundamental Theorem**: For such undiscounted total reward problems with "goal states" and non-negative costs, the **fundamental theorem for MDPs** (which states that the optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, and any greedy policy with respect to it is optimal) can be proven to be true. However, this requires **additional conditions**, unlike the discounted case. For example, one key restriction is that **all policies must be "proper"**, meaning that from every state, the goal state can be reached with a positive probability. Furthermore, all costs must be non-negative, and upon reaching a goal state, no further costs are incurred.
*   **Contrast with Discounted Case**: The discussion of "goal states" directly follows the St. Petersburg paradox because both illustrate the complexities of the undiscounted setting. The St. Petersburg paradox highlights how an **infinite expected value** can arise, leading to a disconnect with intuition. "Goal states" are then presented as a method to impose structure and boundedness on the undiscounted setting to make it tractable. In contrast, the **discounted case is considered "super nice"** because, particularly with finitely many states and actions, it inherently ensures that rewards are bounded, leading to finite and well-defined total rewards and expectations, thus avoiding this "weirdness" altogether without needing additional conditions like "goal states".


The discussion around "goal states" arises in the context of addressing the challenges and "weird stuff" that can occur in the **undiscounted total reward setting** of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This setting is notably "delicate" because, unlike the discounted case, value functions can become infinite (either positive or negative), as illustrated by examples like the St. Petersburg paradox.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the discussion on goal states:

*   **Definition and Purpose of Goal States**
    *   In the undiscounted setting, "goal states" (also referred to as "goa states" or "observing states") are specific states that, once entered, **you stay there indefinitely and receive no further reward or cost**.
    *   This mechanism serves as a "way of dealing with" the issues of potentially infinite values in undiscounted MDPs, ensuring that total accumulated costs or rewards remain finite and well-defined.
    *   When these "goal states" are incorporated, particularly in a cost-minimization context where all costs are non-negative, the problem is analogized to a **stochastic shortest path problem**. The objective in such a problem is to **minimize the total expected cost until a goal state is reached**.

*   **Enabling the Fundamental Theorem**
    *   The speaker explains that for undiscounted total reward problems that utilize these "goal states" (and where costs are non-negative), the **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs can be proven to be true**. This theorem states that the optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, and any greedy policy with respect to it is optimal.
    *   However, unlike the discounted case, proving this theorem in the undiscounted setting with goal states **requires additional conditions**. These include:
        *   **All policies must be "proper"**: This means that from every state, the goal state must be reachable with a positive probability.
        *   **All costs must be non-negative**.
        *   **Upon reaching a goal state, no further costs are incurred**.

*   **Contrast with the Discounted Case**
    *   The discussion on goal states highlights the inherent "delicate" nature of the undiscounted total reward setting. This is explicitly contrasted with the **discounted case, which is considered "super nice"** and "fine".
    *   A key advantage of the discounted case is that if you have **finitely many states and actions, "no further conditions are needed"** for the fundamental theorem to hold. This is because immediate rewards are bounded, ensuring that total rewards and expectations are "well defined" and finite, thus avoiding the "weirdness" of infinite values seen in problems like the St. Petersburg paradox.

In essence, goal states are a structural imposition in undiscounted MDPs to make them mathematically tractable and ensure value functions are well-defined, allowing fundamental theorems to apply under specific restrictions. This contrasts with the discounted case, which inherently avoids these complexities without needing such additional conditions.


The discussion leads up to the mentioning of dynamic programming and Bellman equations by first establishing the **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs** and then explaining its practical implications and the underlying mathematical structure.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the discussion's progression:

1.  **Review of the Fundamental Theorem**: The lecture begins by reviewing what is called the "fundamental theorem for MDPs". This theorem states two crucial things:
    *   The **optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation**.
    *   If you take any **greedy policy with respect to the optimal value function, then this policy is going to be an optimal policy**.
    The lecturer emphasizes that this theorem was proven for the **discounted case** and for **finitely many states and actions**.

2.  **Why Care About This Theorem?**: The discussion later circles back to the question of "why should we care" about this fundamental theorem.
    *   One key reason is that it tells us we can "forget about the past" and "don't need to remember time counter either". This means it's sufficient to consider **memoryless policies** and even **deterministic memoryless policies** for achieving optimal value.
    *   From a practical standpoint, if one were to try to solve an MDP by listing all possible policies, it would be an "infinite uncountably infinite" set (especially for stochastic policies). However, the theorem implies that you **only have to worry about deterministic memoryless policies**, the number of which is bounded (A to the S, where A is actions and S is states). While no one actually lists all of them, policy search methods attempt to reason within this space.

3.  **Introduction of the Bellman Optimality Equation as the Basis for Algorithms and Dynamic Programming**: This leads directly to the second, and perhaps most critical, part of the theorem and its connection to Bellman equations and dynamic programming:
    *   The second part of the theorem "tells us something important," which is that the **optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation**.
    *   This equation is then identified as the **"basis for many of the algorithms" and "many of the ideas that are used in reinforcement learning"**.
    *   It is explicitly stated that this equation embodies **"Bellman's big idea," which is dynamic programming**.
    *   **Dynamic programming** is explained as the idea of "breaking up a problem into sub problems, solve the individual sub problems and compile the solution".
    *   The **Bellman optimality equation achieves this by expressing the optimal value for a given state "in terms of optimal values of well it happens the same state and other states"**. This recursive definition allows for the reduction of the larger problem into smaller, interconnected subproblems.
    *   Bellman's approach, therefore, involved introducing **value functions to "summarize the values"** and then calculating these values. Once the optimal values are known, the optimal policies can be derived. This involves a "two steps" computation.

In summary, the discussion frames the fundamental theorem as a cornerstone that simplifies the search for optimal policies by narrowing down the class of policies to consider. It then highlights that the **Bellman optimality equation is central to this, serving as the mathematical representation of Bellman's dynamic programming principle**, which breaks down the complex problem of finding optimal policies into manageable, recursively solvable subproblems.


The discussion in the video explains how dynamic programming leads to optimality by leveraging the **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs** and the structure of the **Bellman optimality equation**.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **The Foundation: Fundamental Theorem for MDPs**
    *   The lecture begins by stating the **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs**, which has two key parts:
        1.  The **optimal value function (\(V^*\)) is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation**.
        2.  Any **greedy policy with respect to this optimal value function is an optimal policy**.
    *   This theorem is crucial because it provides the theoretical assurance that an optimal policy exists and can be found by focusing on the optimal value function. It also implies that for Markov Decision Processes, **memoryless policies are sufficient for achieving optimality**, meaning you don't need to remember the entire history of states and actions to act optimally.

*   **Dynamic Programming as Bellman's Big Idea**
    *   The Bellman optimality equation is presented as the **"basis for many of the algorithms"** used in reinforcement learning and is identified as **"Bellman's big idea," which is dynamic programming**.
    *   **Dynamic programming** itself is defined as the idea of **"breaking up a problem into sub problems, solve the individual sub problems and compile the solution"**.

*   **How Bellman Equations Embody Dynamic Programming and Lead to Optimality**
    *   The **Bellman optimality equation inherently embodies this dynamic programming principle**. It expresses the optimal value for a given state (which is a "sub problem") in terms of the optimal values of other states (and sometimes even the same state). This recursive definition allows the complex problem of finding optimal actions across an entire MDP to be broken down into smaller, interconnected parts.
    *   Bellman's approach, therefore, involves a **two-step computational process** to achieve optimality:
        1.  **Calculate the optimal value functions**: Bellman's idea was to introduce "value functions that summarize the values" for each state and then compute these optimal values.
        2.  **Derive optimal policies from these values**: Once the optimal values (\(V^*\)) are known, you can simply act greedily with respect to them to find an optimal policy.

*   **The Link to Optimality**: The direct connection to optimality comes from the first part of the fundamental theorem: because the optimal value function *is* the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, solving this equation (through methods like value iteration, which converges at a geometric rate) directly yields the optimal values. Once you have these optimal values, the second part of the theorem guarantees that a greedy policy derived from them will be optimal. This means dynamic programming methods, by iteratively solving or finding the fixed point of the Bellman equation, are designed to converge to the optimal solution.


The question of whether to include the initial-state distribution in the definition of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is one that depends on the context and the specific goals of the theoretical framework or application.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the discussion regarding the inclusion of an initial-state distribution:

*   **No Dependence for the Fundamental Theorem**:
    *   The **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs, as presented, is *not* dependent on any start state distribution**. This theorem states that the optimal value function is the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, and any greedy policy with respect to it is optimal.
    *   The primary reason for excluding it from the fundamental definition is that it allows for the **"best compressed representation of the ideas and results"**. If MDPs were defined with respect to a start state distribution, it would be "really weird and awkward to state terms like that".

*   **Enabling More General Problems**:
    *   Excluding the start state distribution allows for the formulation and solution of **"harder" problems** where the objective is to find a policy that performs well **"no matter what the state is"**.
    *   This is particularly relevant for applications like **robotics**, where you "can't really reset or control the initial state," and therefore, a fixed start state distribution is "not too natural". The goal is for the robot to do "the thing that it needs to do no matter the initial state".
    *   By defining MDPs without a start state distribution, it keeps open "the possibility of asking questions for MDPs without start state distribution".

*   **Contextual Inclusion and Usefulness**:
    *   It is acknowledged that **"in papers, depending on the context, some people are going to include the start state distribution in the definition of the MDPs"**.
    *   While the Bellman equations themselves don't use the start state distribution for their updates, a student suggested that an MDP might be "incomplete without the start state distribution" if it's meant to represent "your world," and that you might not be able to "answer all questions about the MDP unless you also have a start state distribution specified".
    *   If one *can* afford to fix the start state distribution, it's considered "awesome" and might be exploited by algorithms.
    *   Sometimes, start state distributions are introduced "out of necessity" if proving a problem without one would be "just too hard".
    *   For **episodic problems**, a start state distribution is sometimes used, but it's noted that the applicability of a result for a fixed state distribution to all initial states is a separate question.

*   **Existence vs. Utility**:
    *   Regardless of whether it's *included in the formal definition*, a **start state distribution "does exist"** over any given set of states (e.g., a finite state space). The question then becomes whether its *usefulness* is dependent on the problem setting.

In conclusion, while the foundational theorems of MDPs (like the Fundamental Theorem) are often stated independently of an initial-state distribution to ensure broad applicability and focus on the intrinsic properties of the MDP itself, it is common and sometimes necessary to consider an initial-state distribution in specific problem settings, applications, or for practical computational purposes.


The instructor offers a nuanced perspective on average reward settings, acknowledging both their complexities and their utility, especially in theoretical analysis:

*   **Difficulty and Nuances**:
    *   The instructor notes that working with the average reward setting is **"not trivial"**.
    *   Compared to the discounted case, the fundamental theorem for MDPs in the average reward setting often **requires "additional conditions"** for it to hold. In discounted MDPs with finitely many states and actions, no further conditions are needed.
    *   There can be **"weird things"** that happen, such as policies that indefinitely delay taking good actions. Even if such a policy delays for a "billion time steps," its average reward might not be hurt, as it will act optimally for the rest of the infinite future. This behavior is considered "weird" and problematic for proving optimal policies.
    *   This issue causes **"most theory people"** (including the instructor themselves) to be less inclined to work on the average reward setting, as it requires careful consideration of "why our arguments are not exposed in a bad way in this setting".

*   **Community and Practical Relevance**:
    *   The average reward case has seen significant work in the **control community**, while the AI community is "less inclined to work on" it, attributing this difference to "taste and biases and history".
    *   Despite the theoretical challenges, the instructor considers the average reward setting **"promising," "curious," and "interesting,"** possessing an "interesting structure".
    *   For **online learning**, where an algorithm continuously interacts with the environment to collect as much reward as possible over an unknown horizon, the average reward setting often becomes a **crucial tool for analysis**. While the practical goal is often total reward over any horizon, the analysis of these algorithms "is oftentimes through the average reward setting".
    *   However, the instructor cautions that if a policy is only shown to be near-optimal for the average reward case, it might **not guarantee good performance in finite time**, which can be a problem for planning.


The instructor's take on the convergence rate of value iteration is that it **converges at a geometric rate**.

This means:
*   The **distance to the optimum decreases in a geometric fashion**.
*   More precisely, the **distance to the optimal value function in the k-th iteration is some number (smaller than one) raised to the power of k, multiplied by some initial value**. This indicates an extremely fast decrease in error.
*   When asked how many iterations are needed for the error to decrease below a certain epsilon level, the answer is **logarithmic in the inverse of this desired accuracy (log 1/epsilon)**. This is derived by inverting the geometric decrease in errors.
*   The value functions in this process form a Cauchy sequence, as they get progressively closer to the optimal value function.


The instructor's take on the alignment between occupancy measure and the reward vector is that they are **independent entities that work together to define the value function**.

Here's a breakdown of their thoughts:

*   **Independence from Reward Function**: The **state occupancy measure itself is independent of the reward function**. It is solely dependent on the policy and the transition dynamics of the MDP. This is considered a valuable property because it "separates the reward out".
*   **Expression of Value Function**: The **value function can be expressed as a product between a state occupancy measure and the reward function**. This means that while the occupancy measure describes "what's the total occupation for a given state" or "the expected discounted number of times we visit a state-action pair", the reward function then provides the value associated with those state-action occurrences.
*   **Utility of Separation**: This separation is highlighted as being **"super useful"**. It allows for a modular understanding of how value is accumulated in an MDP: the policy and dynamics determine where the agent spends its time (captured by the occupancy measure), and the reward function then determines the 'goodness' of those locations.



The instructor clarifies that while the **Fundamental Theorem for MDPs guarantees that optimal value functions can always be achieved by memoryless policies**, there indeed exist other, generally non-optimal, non-memoryless policies whose specific value functions cannot be reproduced by a memoryless policy **at every state simultaneously**.

Here's the intuition:

*   **Specificity vs. Generality:** A non-memoryless (history-dependent) policy can, by its nature, make decisions and accumulate value based on a very specific sequence of past events. This might lead to a value function that is uniquely tied to such a specific historical context.
*   **Reproduction at a Single State vs. All States:** You might be able to find a memoryless policy that reproduces the value of a specific non-memoryless policy for *one particular starting state*. However, the challenge arises in reproducing that non-memoryless policy's value function *identically for every possible state* using a single memoryless policy. The memoryless policy simply lacks the "memory" to replicate the history-dependent behavior across all arbitrary starting points that might have different implied histories.
*   **Irrelevance for Optimality:** Crucially, the instructor emphasizes that **this specific class of policies is "irrelevant" when seeking optimal solutions**. These non-memoryless policies that cannot be reproduced in full by memoryless policies typically "have bad values". The "very nice coincidence" in MDP theory is that memoryless policies are sufficient to generate the same set of state occupancy measures as a broader set of policies, and this is what allows them to achieve optimal value functions, even if they can't perfectly mimic every non-optimal, history-dependent policy. The memoryless nature of optimal policies is a direct consequence of the Markov property of MDPs, where the current state contains all necessary information for optimal decision-making.


Prabhat's second question concerned the **formulation of reward functions in MDPs**. He noted that different sources, such as the Sutton and Barto book, define reward functions in various ways, including:
*   Using a state, action, and next state.
*   Just using the next state.
*   Using just a state and action (as in the course notes).

Prabhat's core question was whether these different formulations (state-action-next state, next state, or state-action) **make things "okay mathematically" for most theorems and statements** in MDP theory, acknowledging that there might be differences in implementation.

The instructor's take on this alignment is:

*   **Interchangeability for Core Theory**: The instructor states that these formulations are "by and large interchangeable" for the core theoretical results. For example, a formulation depending on state-action-next state can often be rephrased into a state-action-dependent reward by taking an expectation over the next state.
*   **Minimalist Formulation**: The course's use of a reward function dependent only on states and actions is considered the "minimalist interesting formulation".
*   **Markovian Requirement**: Crucially, for the theorems to hold, the **reward cannot "remember the past"**; it must be Markovian and not history-dependent. If the reward itself depended on history, it would no longer be a Markov Decision Process.
*   **Most General Formulation**: The most general and robust definition would involve a "probability kernel that takes the state-action pair and returns a state and the reward together". This allows for **genuinely stochastic rewards** that are not solely dependent on the next state (e.g., adding Gaussian noise to a reward).
*   **Impact on Learning (Beyond the Fundamental Theorem)**: While these different reward formulations might not affect the fundamental mathematical structure when you're simply studying the MDP as a given mathematical entity, they *do* matter significantly **when it comes to learning and gaining information about the MDP**. In learning contexts, the presence and nature of noise in the reward can differentiate the problem's difficulty. For instance, problems with generally stochastic rewards can be fundamentally harder than those with deterministic rewards.


Prabhat's second question concerned the various ways reward functions are defined in different sources (e.g., state-action-next state, next state, or state-action only) and whether these different formulations are **mathematically equivalent** for most theorems and statements in MDP theory, acknowledging potential differences in implementation.

The instructor's take on this is nuanced, highlighting interchangeability for core theory but significant differences for learning:

*   **General Interchangeability for Core Theory**:
    *   The instructor states that, for the core theoretical results, these formulations are **"by and large interchangeable"**.
    *   For instance, a reward formulation that depends on state, action, and the next state can often be **rephrased into a state-action dependent reward by taking an expectation over the next state**.
    *   The course's use of a reward function dependent only on states and actions is considered the **"minimalist interesting formulation"**.

*   **The Crucial Markovian Requirement**:
    *   A fundamental condition for MDP theorems to hold is that the **reward must be Markovian**; it cannot "remember the past" or be history-dependent. If the reward itself depended on history, the process would no longer be a Markov Decision Process.

*   **The Most General Formulation**:
    *   The most general and robust definition of a reward would involve a **"probability kernel that takes the state-action pair and returns a state and the reward together"**.
    *   This formulation allows for **genuinely stochastic rewards** (e.g., adding Gaussian noise to a reward) that are not solely dependent on the next state.
    *   However, for analyzing expected values, the instructor notes that this randomness "just doesn't matter anymore," as the expected reward given a state and an action has "sufficient structure to capture everything that's interesting".

*   **Impact on Learning and Information Gain**:
    *   While these different reward formulations might not alter the fundamental mathematical structure when you're simply studying the MDP as a given entity, they **do matter significantly when it comes to learning and gaining information about the MDP**.
    *   The presence and nature of noise in the reward can affect the problem's difficulty in learning contexts.
    *   There is a **"strong separation"** between problems with genuinely stochastic rewards and those with deterministic rewards, with the former often being fundamentally harder.
    *   Assuming the reward is only a function of state and action **loses something** if the true underlying reward is genuinely stochastic.



Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, Jiamin only asked one question during the lecture. There is no "second question" from Jiamin in the transcript.

Jiamin's single question was about the **intuition behind the statement that there exist non-memoryless policies whose value functions cannot be reproduced by a memoryless policy at every state**, and they asked for an example to better understand it.

The instructor's full response to Jiamin's question was as follows:

*   **Clarification on "Every State"**: The instructor emphasized that the key part of the statement is that the value function **cannot be reproduced "at every state" simultaneously**. You might be able to reproduce the value for a *fixed* starting state, but not identically across all possible states.
*   **Irrelevance for Optimality**: Crucially, the instructor stated that this class of policies is **"irrelevant" when seeking optimal solutions**. They typically "have bad values". The fact that their value functions cannot be fully reproduced by memoryless policies across all states does not affect the search for optimality.
*   **"Nice Coincidence" for Optimal Policies**: There is a **"very nice coincidence"** in MDP theory: memoryless policies are sufficient to reproduce the value functions of *optimal* policies. This is because memoryless policies can generate the same set of state occupancy measures as a broader set of policies, which is what matters for achieving optimal value.
*   **Example (Conceptual)**: While the instructor did not provide a concrete example off the top of their head, they conceptualized that an example would involve a policy that "remembers what it was doing" and makes the value "really bad for some things". Another student offered a conceptual example of a policy that "has to take the same action till the goal state" and only receives a reward if it never "veers off," but "it can't remember why" if it's a memoryless policy. The instructor acknowledged that such examples could be constructed within an MDP framework.



The instructor provides a clear rationale for initially defining policies more broadly to include non-memoryless (history-dependent) policies, even though optimal policies for MDPs are guaranteed to be memoryless.

Here are the key benefits and intuitions for considering the broader class:

*   **Curiosity and Investigation**: The primary reason for not defining policies as memoryless from the start is **curiosity**. If policies were only defined as memoryless, it would be impossible to answer the fundamental question of **whether it's important to remember the history or not** when making decisions in an MDP. By defining a broader class, one can then investigate and prove that, for optimal behavior in MDPs, remembering history is indeed unnecessary.
*   **Demonstrating Markov Structure Sufficiency**: It needs to be explicitly **shown** that the Markov property of the MDP allows one to forget everything about the past if the current state is known, even in controlled Markov chains with rewards. This is not "completely automatic" and requires proof, which is facilitated by first considering the broader policy class.
*   **Relevance to Learning Algorithms**:
    *   While optimal policies are memoryless, **learning algorithms themselves are inherently non-stationary and depend on history**.
    *   When an agent learns (e.g., updates the weights of a neural network based on past experiences), the policy it executes at any given time depends on what it has seen before. This makes the policy effectively non-stationary and history-dependent during the learning process.
    *   Therefore, to **theoretically study these learning algorithms** and "make claims about them," or to show that "there is no learning algorithm that can do certain things" (narrative results), it is **unavoidable** to define and consider this broader class of policies. A learning algorithm, when connected with an MDP, gives rise to a non-stationary policy.

In summary, while the "fundamental theorem" proves that memoryless policies are sufficient for achieving optimal value, the broader definition is crucial for the theoretical completeness of MDPs, to validate the power of the Markov property, and especially to meaningfully analyze and reason about learning algorithms in reinforcement learning.


The instructor addressed the question of why policies are not initially defined as memoryless, despite the fundamental theorem indicating that optimal values can be achieved by such policies.

Here is an expanded response outlining the benefits and intuition behind considering the broader class of non-memoryless policies:

*   **Curiosity and Fundamental Investigation**: The primary reason for not restricting policies to be memoryless from the outset is **curiosity**. If the definition of a policy were limited to only memoryless policies, it would be impossible to **investigate and answer the fundamental question of whether remembering history is important** for optimal decision-making in an MDP. By starting with a broader definition, one can then formally prove that, for optimal behavior, historical information beyond the current state is indeed unnecessary.
*   **Demonstrating the Sufficiency of Markov Structure**: The broad definition is essential to **demonstrate that the Markov property** of the underlying process (a controlled Markov chain with rewards) allows one to "forget everything about the past if you know the state". This is not an "automatic" conclusion and requires a formal proof, which is facilitated by first considering a wider range of policies. The fundamental theorem itself, as presented in the lecture, explicitly defines the optimal value with respect to *all policies*, including history-dependent and non-stationary ones, before proving that these broader policies "do not add anything to the charity" (meaning they don't offer better performance).
*   **Relevance to Learning Algorithms**: This is a critical benefit of the broader definition.
    *   While optimal policies are proven to be memoryless for a *known* MDP, **learning algorithms themselves are inherently non-stationary and history-dependent**.
    *   During the learning process (e.g., when an agent updates the weights of a neural network based on past experiences), the policy it executes at any given time is influenced by what it has observed and learned from its history. This makes the executed policy effectively non-stationary and dependent on the entire history of interactions.
    *   Therefore, to **theoretically study these learning algorithms** and "make claims about them," or to show that "there is no learning algorithm that can do certain things" (narrative results), it is **unavoidable to define and consider this broader class of policies**. A learning algorithm, when coupled with an MDP, intrinsically "gives rise to a non-stationary policy".

In essence, while the fundamental theorem provides the elegant result that memoryless policies are sufficient for optimality in an MDP, the initial broader definition is crucial for the theoretical completeness of the framework, to formally prove the power of the Markov property, and most importantly, to meaningfully analyze and reason about the behavior and limitations of reinforcement learning algorithms, which are themselves history-dependent processes.



The sources do not directly address the question of whether it's possible to prove that some specific epsilon is the minimum one of all epsilon-optimal policies. However, the provided information suggests that such a minimum positive epsilon is not a concept discussed for MDPs in this context, and instead, performance degrades gracefully as policies move away from true optimality.

Here's what the instructor's response implies regarding "near optimality" or "epsilon-optimality":

*   **Relaxing Optimality for Practicality**: The instructor acknowledges that calculating anything that is truly optimal often cannot be afforded in practice. Therefore, the concept of **"near optimal"** policies becomes highly relevant and useful.
*   **Graceful Degradation of Performance**: The fundamental theorem, which states that optimal value functions are fixed points of the Bellman optimality equation and that greedy policies with respect to optimal value functions are optimal, is **not "too brittle"**. This means that if you have a value function that is **"close to the optimal value function,"** then taking a greedy policy with respect to this *imperfect* value function will result in a **"near optimal"** policy. This implies that there is a **"graceful degradation of the performance"** if you are "imperfectly evaluating things," which is almost always the case in real-world scenarios.
*   **Implication for Epsilon**: This "graceful degradation" suggests that the "epsilon" (the measure of how far a policy's performance is from the optimal) can be made arbitrarily small by improving the accuracy of the value function approximation. The discussion on the convergence rate of value iteration further supports this, stating that the distance to the optimum in value functions decreases at a **geometric rate**, meaning the error can decrease below an epsilon level in a logarithmic number of iterations (often referred to as "log one over epsilon"). This indicates that theoretically, you can get arbitrarily close to the optimal value function, which in turn means policies can be arbitrarily close to optimal.

Therefore, based on the provided sources, the focus is on the ability to achieve policies that are *arbitrarily close* to optimal, rather than identifying a specific non-zero "minimum epsilon" that all epsilon-optimal policies must satisfy. The concept presented is that performance approaches optimality as your approximation of the value function improves, allowing for policies with diminishing "epsilon" values.


The instructor addressed a query very similar to yours regarding the notation for policies, specifically the difference between a "probability simplex over the number of actions" and `M_1(A)`.

The instructor's response indicates that for finite action spaces, **there is no fundamental difference between these two notations**. They are essentially two ways of describing the same mathematical concept:

*   **Equivalence for Finite Actions**: "No, nothing. It's basically the same for finite okay in that case they're the same set right like if you have one thing like if you have an element of one set it's also an element of the other set of induces an element of the other set and vice versa so it's like they're completely the same".
*   **Notation Consistency**: The choice to use `M_1(A)` might simply be for consistency with other measure-theoretic notations being used in the course.

Your hypothesis about assigning distributions over *subsets* of actions is not explicitly discussed, but given the instructor's direct statement that "they're completely the same" for finite action spaces, it implies that both notations refer to probability distributions over the *individual* actions within the action set, not necessarily subsets of actions. If the action space were continuous, then `M_1(A)` (representing probability measures on the action space) would indeed be a more general and appropriate notation than a finite-dimensional simplex. However, in the context of finite states and actions as typically discussed for the fundamental theorem, the two concepts are equivalent.


Yes, your understanding is correct. An **occupancy measure** can be understood as **the expected discounted number of times we visit a state-action pair**.

More broadly, the instructor defines occupancy measures as capturing the **"total occupation"** for a given state or state-action pair along a trajectory induced by a policy, starting from some initial distribution.

Here are some key points about occupancy measures as described in the sources:

*   **Foundation for Proofs**: The instructor found that using discounted state occupancy measures provided the "shortest and most elegant" argument to prove the fundamental theorem.
*   **Separation of Reward**: A significant benefit of occupancy measures is that they are independent of the reward function; they only depend on the policy and the MDP's transition dynamics. This allows the value of a policy to be expressed as an inner product between the state occupancy measure and the reward function, which is "super useful".
*   **Equivalence with Memoryless Policies**: For any given policy and initial state distribution, you can always find a **stationary memoryless policy** (a "pi prime memory less policy") that reproduces the same discounted state occupancy measure. This is a crucial point, as it explains why history-dependent or non-stationary policies "do not add anything at all" to the possible set of state occupancy measures they can generate. Essentially, memoryless policies are sufficient to generate the same class of state occupancy measures as a broader set of policies.
*   **Irrelevance for Suboptimal Policies**: While the fundamental theorem holds that optimal value functions can be achieved by memoryless policies, there might exist non-memoryless policies whose value functions *cannot* be reproduced by a memoryless policy at *every* state. However, this is considered "completely irrelevant" if the primary concern is only optimal policies.


Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, there is **no direct mention of a "policy-state-occupancy operator" that acts on a state-occupancy vector or matrix and converges to the state-occupancy measure for a given policy**.

The sources primarily define and discuss occupancy measures in the following ways:

*   **Definition**: An occupancy measure captures the **"total occupation"** for a given state or state-action pair along a trajectory induced by a policy, starting from some initial distribution. You correctly understood it as **"the expected discounted number of times we visit a state-action pair"** [conversational remark, 25].
*   **Dependence**: Occupancy measures are dependent only on the **policy** and the **transition dynamics** of the MDP, and are explicitly stated to be **independent of the reward function**. This separation allows the value of a policy to be expressed as an inner product between the state occupancy measure and the reward function, which is considered **"super useful"**.
*   **Sufficiency of Memoryless Policies**: A key insight presented is that for any given policy (including history-dependent or non-stationary ones) and initial state distribution, you can always find a **stationary memoryless policy** that **reproduces the same discounted state occupancy measure**. This is why, in the context of optimal policies, memoryless policies "do not add anything at all" to the class of state occupancy measures they can generate.

The concept of "convergence" in the sources is predominantly discussed in the context of **value iteration algorithms converging to the optimal value function**. The optimal value function is defined as the fixed point of the Bellman optimality equation, and value iteration is a process that iteratively updates the value function until it converges to this fixed point at a **geometric rate**. This means the error decreases below an epsilon level in a logarithmic number of iterations (often referred to as **"log one over epsilon"**).

While the state occupancy measure is a fundamental concept for understanding the behavior of a policy within an MDP, especially for proving results like the fundamental theorem, the provided material does not describe an iterative "operator" for an *occupancy measure itself* that converges for a *given* (fixed) policy. For a fixed policy, the occupancy measure is a direct mathematical consequence of that policy and the MDP's dynamics, rather than something derived through an iterative convergence process akin to value iteration for value functions.



Here are some nuanced insights from the sources that expand upon our conversation:

*   **The "Why Care" of the Fundamental Theorem Beyond Just Optimality**:
    *   The fundamental theorem is pivotal because it shows that **optimal actions do not require remembering the past or a time counter**. This means that for optimality in discounted MDPs, it's sufficient to consider **memoryless policies**, which only depend on the current state, and specifically **deterministic memoryless policies**. This insight dramatically reduces the search space for optimal policies from an uncountably infinite set to a finite set (A^S, where A is the number of actions and S is the number of states). This is a crucial practical implication for solving MDPs.
    *   The Bellman optimality equation, whose fixed point is the optimal value function, is highlighted as **"the basis for many of the algorithms" in reinforcement learning**. This is because it embodies the dynamic programming principle of breaking a large problem (finding the optimal policy) into smaller subproblems (finding optimal values for individual states), which can then be compiled to form the overall solution.

*   **The Delicate Nature of Non-Discounted MDP Settings**:
    *   While the fundamental theorem is "super nice" for the discounted case, it becomes **"quite delicate" for the total reward (undiscounted) setting**. The primary issue is that **value functions may not be well-defined**, potentially becoming infinite (positive or negative).
    *   This problem is famously illustrated by the **St. Petersburg Paradox**, where a game has an infinite expected monetary value, but people are intuitively unwilling to pay a large sum to play it, demonstrating that expectations alone may not be the "best thing" in such scenarios.
    *   To make the undiscounted case tractable and ensure values are well-defined, **additional conditions are often required**. For example, in **Stochastic Shortest Path problems**, policies must be "proper" (able to reach a "goal state" with positive probability from any state), and costs non-negative, to ensure the fundamental theorem holds and values are finite.
    *   Similarly, in the **average reward setting**, "weird things" can occur, such as policies that **indefinitely delay taking good actions** without affecting their long-term average reward. This conceptual difficulty often leads theory practitioners to approach this setting with caution, though it remains highly relevant for the analysis of online learning algorithms.

*   **MDP Models as Abstractions with Inherent Imperfections**:
    *   The instructor emphasizes that MDPs are **"imperfect" mathematical frameworks** for modeling real-world problems. Concepts like an **infinite horizon** are abstractions that "will never happen" in reality (e.g., interacting with a system infinitely) but serve to simplify analysis by avoiding time-dependent optimal policies (which occur in finite horizon settings). The choice of model often balances realism with mathematical tractability.
    *   The inclusion or exclusion of a **start state distribution** in the definition of an MDP is "somewhat arbitrary". While Bellman equations and updates don't require it, its presence can limit the generality of questions asked. The instructor prefers defining MDPs without a fixed start state distribution to aim for policies that act well "no matter the initial state," which is a harder but more general problem.
    *   Regarding **reward function formulation** (e.g., dependence on `(s,a)` or `(s,a,s')`), while largely interchangeable for analytical purposes when the MDP is known, there are "big differences" if the reward is **genuinely stochastic** (e.g., includes Gaussian noise not captured by the next state transition). Such stochasticity *does* matter when discussing learning algorithms, as it impacts how information is gained from the environment.

*   **The Rationale for Considering Broader Policy Classes**:
    *   The fundamental theorem explicitly defines the optimal value function `V*` with respect to **all policies, including history-dependent and non-stationary ones**, not just stationary Markov policies. This broader definition is crucial because **it allows one to prove that such complex policies "do not add anything at all"** to the set of achievable optimal values in discounted Markov Decision Processes. Without this initial broader definition, one couldn't even ask or prove that question.
    *   Furthermore, considering non-memoryless policies is **essential for understanding and analyzing learning algorithms**. When a learning agent updates its policy (e.g., neural network weights) based on past experiences, the resulting policy is inherently **non-stationary and history-dependent**. Therefore, to theoretically study the behavior and guarantees of these algorithms, it's unavoidable to define and consider this broader class of policies.


You're looking for deeper, less obvious insights from the sources that we haven't explicitly covered in our previous exchanges. Here's a breakdown of additional nuanced points:

*   **The "Why Care" of the Fundamental Theorem - Beyond Just Optimality**:
    *   The fundamental theorem's profound impact is that it demonstrates **optimal actions do not require remembering the past or tracking a time counter**. This implies that for discounted MDPs, it's sufficient to consider **memoryless policies**, which only depend on the current state, and specifically **deterministic memoryless policies**.
    *   This understanding **dramatically reduces the search space for optimal policies** from an uncountably infinite set (for all possible policies) to a finite set (A^S, where A is the number of actions and S is the number of states), making the problem computationally tractable.
    *   The Bellman optimality equation, the fixed point of which is the optimal value function, is highlighted as **"the basis for many of the algorithms" in reinforcement learning**. This is because it embodies the dynamic programming principle of **breaking a large problem into smaller subproblems** that can be solved and compiled.

*   **The "Brittleness" and Robustness of Optimality**:
    *   While the fundamental theorem focuses on strict optimality, the concept is **not "too brittle"** in practice. This means that if you have a value function that is **close to the optimal value function**, taking the greedy policy with respect to this near-optimal value function will result in a **near-optimal policy**.
    *   There's a **"graceful degradation of the performance"** when evaluations are imperfect, which is almost always the case in real-world scenarios. This makes the theoretical result useful even when perfect optimality cannot be achieved.

*   **Why Broader Policy Classes (History-Dependent/Non-Stationary) are Considered**:
    *   The optimal value function `V*` is initially defined with respect to **all policies, including history-dependent and non-stationary ones**, not just stationary Markov policies. This **broader definition is crucial** because it allows one to formally prove that such complex policies **"do not add anything at all"** to the set of achievable optimal values in discounted Markov Decision Processes. Without this initial broader definition, the question of their necessity couldn't even be asked or proven.
    *   Furthermore, considering non-memoryless policies is **essential for understanding and analyzing learning algorithms**. When a learning agent updates its policy (e.g., adjusting neural network weights) based on past experiences, the resulting policy is inherently **non-stationary and history-dependent**. Therefore, to theoretically study the behavior and guarantees of these algorithms, it's unavoidable to define and consider this broader class of policies.

*   **Nuances of Reward Function Formulation**:
    *   The most general Markovian reward formulation discussed involves a **probability kernel that takes a state-action pair and returns a next state and a reward together**.
    *   While reward formulations like `R(s,a)` or `R(s,a,s')` are often interchangeable when the MDP is known and the reward is deterministic, there are **"big differences" if the reward is genuinely stochastic** (e.g., includes Gaussian noise not fully captured by the next state transition).
    *   Such genuine stochasticity **does matter when discussing learning algorithms** because it impacts how information is gained from the environment. Problems with genuinely stochastic rewards can be fundamentally harder than those with deterministic rewards.

*   **Subtle Distinction in Occupancy Measure Sufficiency**:
    *   While it's true that any policy's discounted state occupancy measure can be reproduced by a stationary memoryless policy, there's a subtle point: some **non-memoryless policies might have value functions that cannot be reproduced *at every state*** by a memoryless policy.
    *   However, this distinction is **"completely irrelevant" if the primary concern is only optimal policies**, as the fundamental theorem guarantees optimal values *can* be achieved by memoryless policies. This highlights that the sufficiency is specific to optimal values/policies, not *all* possible policy behaviors.

*   **Finite Horizon vs. Infinite Horizon - A Fundamental Difference**:
    *   The finite horizon setting is **"fundamentally different"** from the infinite horizon discounted setting. This is because in finite horizon problems, as you approach the end of the time horizon, the **optimal actions are inherently non-stationary**; they depend on the time remaining.
    *   For example, near a deadline, you wouldn't pursue a large reward that takes too long to reach. While this can be rephrased by adding a time index to the state (making it "stationary" in an augmented state space), the underlying reality is that the policies are time-dependent. Proving theorems for finite horizon often involves backwards induction and can be easier.

These insights emphasize the careful definitions, deliberate choices, and underlying theoretical implications that support the application of MDPs in reinforcement learning.


The discussion on the "Brittleness" and Robustness of Optimality addresses a crucial practical concern regarding the fundamental theorem of MDPs and its focus on strict optimality. The question arises: "isn't this just too brittle?", implying that if a solution needs to be perfectly optimal to be useful, it might be impractical given the complexities of real-world problems.

The nuanced insight is that **optimality is not "too brittle" in practice**. While the fundamental theorem specifically discusses strict optimality, its utility extends beyond achieving perfect solutions.

Here's the breakdown of the discussion:

*   **The Nature of Optimality**: The fundamental theorem defines and guarantees the existence of optimal policies and value functions. However, in many real-world scenarios, agents may not be able to compute or achieve perfectly optimal solutions due to various constraints, such as computational limits or imperfect knowledge of the environment. The question then becomes whether the framework is still useful when perfect optimality is not feasible.

*   **Relaxation and Graceful Degradation**: The sources explain that the results of the fundamental theorem can be relaxed. It's not just about finding the exact optimal policy; rather, **if you have a value function that is *close* to the optimal value function, then taking the greedy policy with respect to this near-optimal value function will result in a *near-optimal policy***. This is a key insight because it means that even with imperfect evaluations, the system's performance does not "break down in a sudden way". Instead, there is a **"graceful degradation of the performance"**.

*   **Practical Implications**: This robustness is highly significant for practical applications of reinforcement learning. In almost all real-world situations, learning algorithms and agents will be "imperfectly evaluating things". The fact that good approximate solutions lead to good performance ensures that the theoretical framework of MDPs remains highly applicable and useful, even when perfect optimality is an unreachable ideal.


The discussion highlights a **fundamental distinction between finite and infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**, particularly concerning the role of time, deadlines, and the stationarity of optimal policies.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

*   **Fundamental Nature of Time Dependence**:
    *   The **infinite horizon discounted setting has "stationarity burned into it"**. This means that the optimal actions in such a setting do not depend on the specific time step or on remembering the past; they are determined solely by the current state.
    *   In contrast, the **finite horizon setting is "fundamentally different"** because its optimal actions are **inherently non-stationary; they depend on time**. As you approach the end of the specified time horizon, the optimal actions will change.

*   **Impact of Time-outs and Deadlines**:
    *   In a finite horizon problem, **deadlines directly influence optimal decision-making**. For instance, if you have a limited time left to achieve a goal, you wouldn't pursue an action that leads to a large reward but takes more time than available. Your strategy would adapt to the remaining time, prioritizing feasible rewards.
    *   This is precisely how **time-outs and deadlines are modeled**: the remaining time dictates the optimal policy at any given moment.

*   **Policy Stationarity**:
    *   For infinite horizon discounted MDPs, the **fundamental theorem guarantees that optimal policies are stationary and memoryless**. This dramatically simplifies the search for optimal policies as you only need to consider policies that depend solely on the current state, not on past actions or the current time step.
    *   In the finite horizon setting, because actions depend on the time remaining, the **optimal policies are not stationary memoryless policies**. They vary with time.

*   **Mathematical Implications and Proof Methods**:
    *   While the sources do not provide explicit mathematical formulas for the finite horizon Bellman optimality equation, they describe its nature. In this setting, you must **define value functions in terms of "how much time is left or how much time have elapsed from the beginning of time"**. This implies time-indexed value functions, such as \(V_t(s)\), where \(t\) is the time step or time remaining.
    *   The corresponding theorems for finite horizon problems are often **"even easier to prove"** and typically rely on **backwards induction**. This iterative method starts by calculating the optimal values for the very last time step and then works backward in time to determine the optimal values for earlier time steps.
    *   If one wishes to force a finite horizon problem into a "stationary" framework, it can be done by **augmenting the state space to include a time index** (e.g., considering \((s, t)\) as a single state). However, this is merely a **"rephrasing"**; the underlying non-stationary nature of the optimal policy (which will still depend on the time component of the augmented state) remains.

*   **Modeling Choices and Practicality**:
    *   The choice to model a problem with an infinite horizon, even when real-world interactions are finite, is often an **abstraction chosen for convenience and analytical tractability**. It avoids the need to explicitly define a deadline and the complexities of time-dependent policies.
    *   Setting an "arbitrary deadline" in a finite horizon model for a continuous AI application, for example, could lead to **"awkward" solutions where the system might "stop exploring"** or act suboptimally as the deadline approaches. This is generally undesirable for systems meant to operate continuously or for an unknown duration.
    *   However, finite horizon models are very realistic for problems with clear, fixed end points or deadlines.

In essence, while the infinite horizon (especially discounted) offers mathematical elegance and guarantees of stationary optimal policies, the finite horizon setting inherently incorporates the real-world impact of deadlines and time-outs, necessitating time-dependent policies and backward induction for analysis.


The discussion on the "Brittleness" and Robustness of Optimality addresses a critical practical concern: whether the theoretical concept of strict optimality in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is too fragile for real-world applications.

While the sources clearly articulate the *concept* of robustness, they **do not provide explicit mathematical formulas or formal proofs to quantify "close" or "near-optimal"** in the immediate context of this particular discussion on brittleness. The provided material describes the principle and its implications rather than detailing the underlying mathematical inequalities or convergence bounds for this specific point.

However, the core idea, as presented, is that optimality is **not "too brittle" in practice**. Here's how the sources explain it:

*   **The Concern:** The fundamental theorem focuses on defining and guaranteeing the existence of optimal policies and value functions. However, a natural question arises: "isn't this just too brittle?". This refers to the worry that if an agent needs to calculate or achieve a *perfectly* optimal solution to be useful, the framework might be impractical, given that perfectly evaluating or solving an MDP is often impossible in real-world scenarios due to computational limits or imperfect knowledge.

*   **The Resolution through Relaxation:** The theoretical results stemming from the fundamental theorem can be "relaxed". This means that the utility of the framework extends beyond the strict achievement of perfect optimality.

*   **The Core Insight on Robustness:** The crucial understanding is that **"if you have a value function which is close to the optimal value function you take the greedy policy with respect to this then that policy is going to be near optimal"**. This implies a direct relationship: good approximations of the optimal value function lead to good, albeit not perfectly optimal, policies.

*   **Graceful Degradation of Performance:** This property ensures that the system's performance does not "break down in a sudden way" when evaluations are imperfect. Instead, there is a **"graceful degradation of the performance"**. This is highly significant because, in practical reinforcement learning applications, agents will "pretty much all the time" be "imperfectly evaluating things". The robustness property ensures that these inevitable imperfections do not render the theoretical framework useless, making it highly applicable even when perfect optimality remains an ideal.

In summary, while the explicit mathematical details (e.g., specific bounds on "near-optimality" given an error in the value function) are not supplied in these excerpts, the underlying principle is that the framework is robust: approximate solutions to the Bellman optimality equation yield approximately optimal policies, allowing for practical utility in imperfect real-world settings.


The fundamental theorem of MDPs, as initially introduced, primarily focuses on the **discounted infinite horizon case with finitely many states and actions**. This setting is considered "super nice" because it requires no further conditions for the theorem to hold true. However, the sources indicate that similar fundamental theorems or related principles apply to other settings, often with additional conditions or different mathematical approaches.

Here's a breakdown of how optimality is addressed in these other settings:

*   **Finite Horizon Setting**
    *   This setting is described as **"fundamentally different"** from the infinite horizon discounted setting because it **lacks stationarity**. This means that the optimal actions in a finite horizon problem are **inherently non-stationary; they depend on time**.
    *   As you approach the end of the horizon, your optimal actions will change. For example, if you have limited time and a large reward is too far to reach within that time, you won't pursue it. This is precisely how **deadlines and time-outs influence optimal decision-making**.
    *   Mathematically, in the finite horizon setting, **value functions must be defined in terms of "how much time is left or how much time have elapsed from the beginning of time"**. The corresponding theorems are "even easier to prove" and typically rely on **backwards induction**.
    *   Because the optimal policies depend on the remaining time, they are **not stationary memoryless policies**. While one could technically "rephrase" this by augmenting the state space to include a time index (e.g., \((s, t)\) as a state), the underlying time-dependent nature of the optimal policy remains.
    *   From a modeling perspective, finite horizon models are highly realistic for problems with **clear, fixed end points or deadlines**. However, for continuous applications like AI systems meant to operate indefinitely, setting an "arbitrary deadline" could lead to "awkward" solutions where the system might "stop exploring" or act suboptimally as the deadline approaches, which is generally undesirable.

*   **Infinite Horizon Undiscounted (Total Reward) Setting**
    *   This case is described as **"quite delicate"** because there's no guarantee that the value functions are well-defined and finite; they could be minus infinity or infinity. This is not merely a "mathematical weirdness" but a significant practical issue, as demonstrated by examples like the **St. Petersburg Paradox**, where the expected reward is infinite, making it difficult to determine a "fair price" for the game based solely on expectation.
    *   To address this, **additional conditions** are often required for the values to be well-defined. For instance, if one consistently works with "costs" (non-negative values), it can be more natural to ensure finite sums.
    *   A notable example where the fundamental theorem applies in an undiscounted setting is the **Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem**. In SSP, problems are well-behaved if there are "goal states" that, once entered, absorb the agent with no further cost, and all policies are "proper" (meaning they can reach a goal state with positive probability from any state). Under such restrictions, the fundamental theorem holds.
    *   For cases with **infinitely many states and actions**, it often becomes necessary to assume that the **reward or cost is bounded** for the Bellman optimality equation and related theorems to hold. Without this assumption, costs can "run away," indicating a system breakdown.
    *   Modeling with an infinite horizon, even when real-world interaction is finite, is often an **abstraction chosen for analytical convenience and tractability**, as it avoids the complexities of time-dependent policies inherent in finite horizons.

*   **Average Reward Setting**
    *   This setting is very similar to the total reward undiscounted case and is often "case based".
    *   The average reward setting has been a focus in the control community more than in the broader AI/RL community.
    *   A significant challenge in this setting is that **policies can exhibit "weird things,"** such as delaying optimal actions indefinitely without hurting their average reward, which can make theoretical guarantees problematic. This is why some researchers are less inclined to work on it directly.
    *   However, the average reward setting is considered **promising and interesting**, especially for the analysis of **online learning algorithms**. In online learning, agents continuously interact and collect rewards over an unknown or potentially infinite horizon, and average reward concepts are often used to prove stronger results about their long-term performance.
    *   For **planning** (where a policy is output after training, not adapted during interaction), average reward performance might not directly translate to good finite-time performance, which is an issue.

In essence, while the discounted infinite horizon case is the most straightforward for proving the fundamental theorem, the principles of optimality extend to other settings. However, these extensions often necessitate **different mathematical techniques** (like backwards induction for finite horizon) and **additional conditions** (like proper policies or bounded rewards for undiscounted cases) to ensure the well-definition of values and the practical applicability of the resulting policies.


Considering broader policy classes, including history-dependent and non-stationary policies, in the theoretical framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) serves several crucial purposes, even though the fundamental theorem often concludes that optimal policies can be found within the simpler class of deterministic memoryless policies. The "mathematical explanation" for their initial inclusion and subsequent relevance is multi-faceted:

### 1. To Prove Redundancy for Optimality in Markovian Settings

The fundamental theorem of MDPs, especially for the discounted infinite horizon case with finitely many states and actions, begins by defining the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) **with respect to *all* possible policies**, including those that are history-dependent and non-stationary. The very point of this theorem is to mathematically demonstrate that these broader classes of policies **"do not add anything to the [optimality]"** in a Markovian context.

The core mathematical argument supporting this is through the concept of **discounted state occupancy measures**:
*   A state occupancy measure represents the total expected discounted time spent in a given state.
*   The argument shows that **for *any* policy** (regardless of whether it's history-dependent or non-stationary) and a given initial state distribution, you can always **find another policy which is a stationary, memoryless policy that *reproduces the exact same discounted state occupancy measure***.
*   Crucially, the value function (expected return) can be expressed as a product between a state occupancy measure and the reward function.
*   Therefore, because memoryless policies can generate the same set of state occupancy measures as the larger set of all possible policies, it mathematically follows that they can achieve the same (or better) expected returns.
*   This means that if a history-dependent policy achieves a certain value, a memoryless policy can achieve at least that value, making the **memoryless policies sufficient for achieving optimality** in these settings.
*   Essentially, by considering the broader class, the theorem *proves* that you can **"forget about the past and we don't need to remember time counter either"** when aiming for optimality in a standard MDP, because the Markov property (where the future only depends on the current state) renders history irrelevant for optimal decision-making.

### 2. Inherent Necessity in Other MDP Settings

While the "super nice" discounted case permits memoryless optimal policies, other MDP settings inherently require or benefit from considering non-stationary or history-dependent policies:

*   **Finite Horizon Setting**: This setting is **"fundamentally different"** because it **lacks stationarity**. Optimal actions inherently **depend on time** (e.g., "how much time is left") because the horizon is fixed. For instance, if a deadline is approaching, a policy might change its actions to prioritize short-term gains over long-term, far-off rewards that cannot be reached in time. While one could technically "rephrase this by adding to the state a time index," the underlying fact is that the optimal policies are **not stationary memoryless policies** in the traditional sense. Theorems in this setting are often proved via backwards induction, which naturally yields time-dependent optimal policies.

### 3. Relevance for Learning Algorithms

Perhaps one of the most practically significant reasons for considering broader policy classes lies in **reinforcement learning algorithms**:
*   Learning algorithms are inherently **non-stationary and history-dependent**. As an agent interacts with an environment and learns (e.g., by updating the weights of a neural network), its policy continuously changes based on the experience (history) it has accumulated.
*   When a learning algorithm takes an action, this action "depends on what you have seen before," meaning **"everything is non-stationary"** during the learning process.
*   Therefore, to **theoretically study these learning algorithms** and make claims about their performance (e.g., showing what they *can* or *cannot* achieve), it is **"unavoidable to define these things"** – i.e., to consider the broader class of non-stationary, history-dependent policies. Without doing so, it would be impossible to even formulate questions or prove "negative results" about these algorithms.

In summary, the broader classes of policies are considered not because they are necessary for achieving optimal returns in the "super nice" discounted Markovian setting (where they are mathematically proven to be redundant for optimality through occupancy measures), but rather to **establish that mathematical fact itself**, and because they are **inherently present and necessary for modeling and analyzing other, more complex MDP settings (like finite horizon problems) and real-world learning systems**.


The paradox mentioned in the sources is the **St. Petersburg Paradox** (also referred to as the "rich paradox the san peterborough paradox").

Here's an explanation of the paradox and why it's considered important in the context of MDPs:

*   **What is the St. Petersburg Paradox?**
    *   It's a game or lottery where you pay an upfront fixed cost to play.
    *   A fair coin is flipped repeatedly.
    *   If the first "head" appears on the \(k\)-th flip, you are paid \(2^{k-1}\) dollars. For example, if the first head is on the first flip, you get \(1; if on the second, \)2; if on the third, $4, and so on, with the reward doubling for each subsequent flip until a head appears.
    *   **The mathematical expectation (expected reward) of this game is infinite**. This is because the probability of the game ending on the \(k\)-th trial is \(1/2^k\), and when multiplied by the reward of \(2^{k-1}\), it gives a value that, when summed over all possible \(k\) from 1 to infinity, results in an infinite total expected value.
    *   **The paradox arises because despite this infinite expected value, most people are not willing to pay an infinite, or even a very large, amount of money to play the game**. This highlights a disparity between theoretical expected value and practical human decision-making, which often accounts for risk and the low probability of extremely high returns.

*   **Why do we care about it in MDPs?**
    *   **Challenges in the Infinite Horizon Undiscounted Setting:** The St. Petersburg Paradox serves as a prime example of the difficulties encountered in the **infinite horizon undiscounted (total reward) setting** of MDPs. In this setting, there is **no guarantee that the value functions are well-defined and finite**; they could potentially be minus infinity or infinity. The St. Petersburg Paradox illustrates this "mathematical weirdness" where infinite expectations can arise.
    *   **Need for Additional Conditions:** Because such "infinite expectations" can occur, this setting is described as "quite delicate". It necessitates the introduction of **additional conditions** for the values to be well-defined and for theorems like the fundamental theorem of MDPs to hold. For instance, in the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem, which is an undiscounted case, conditions like having "goal states" that absorb the agent with no further cost, and policies being "proper" (reaching a goal state with positive probability), are required for the fundamental theorem to be true.
    *   **Bounded Rewards Assumption:** For cases with infinitely many states and actions, it often becomes necessary to assume that the **reward or cost is bounded** for the Bellman optimality equation and related theorems to hold. Without this assumption, costs can "run away," indicating a potential "system breaks" scenario. The St. Petersburg Paradox demonstrates what happens when rewards are unbounded.
    *   **Beyond Expected Value:** The paradox teaches an important lesson: **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"** if you're in a scenario like the St. Petersburg Paradox, as it doesn't account for risk or the practical implications of highly skewed distributions.
    *   **Model Imperfections:** It reminds us that MDP models are **abstractions and imperfect** representations of real-world problems. While they are useful, we must be aware of their limitations and how they might lead to "awkward" or unrealistic solutions if not applied with caution, especially when dealing with unbounded rewards or infinite horizons.



The St. Petersburg Paradox, also referred to as "the rich paradox the San Peterborough paradox," is a key concept discussed in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly for understanding the challenges of the infinite horizon undiscounted setting.

Here's a comprehensive discussion of the paradox and the insights it yields:

### The St. Petersburg Paradox Explained

The St. Petersburg Paradox describes a game or lottery with a peculiar outcome when calculating its expected value.

*   **The Game Setup**: You pay an upfront fixed cost to play. A fair coin is flipped repeatedly.
*   **The Reward**: If the first "head" appears on the \(k\)-th flip, you are paid \(2^{k-1}\) dollars.
    *   For example, if the first head is on the 1st flip, you get $1.
    *   If it's on the 2nd flip, you get $2.
    *   If it's on the 3rd flip, you get $4, and so on, with the reward doubling for each subsequent flip until a head appears.
*   **The Infinite Expectation**: The probability of the game ending on the \(k\)-th trial is \(1/2^k\). When this probability is multiplied by the reward (\(2^{k-1}\)), the term for each \(k\) is \(1/2\) (since \(2^{k-1}/2^k = 1/2\)). When summed over all possible \(k\) from 1 to infinity, the **expected reward of this game is infinite**.
*   **The Paradox**: Despite this infinite expected value, **most people are not willing to pay an infinite, or even a very large, amount of money to play the game**. This highlights a significant disparity between theoretical expected value and practical human decision-making, which often accounts for risk and the low probability of extremely high returns. People tend to be risk-averse, focusing on the high probability of losing in the very first few flips.

### Insights Yielded for MDPs

The St. Petersburg Paradox is a crucial illustration of why certain conditions and modeling choices are made in MDP theory, especially outside of the "super nice" discounted case.

1.  **Challenges in the Infinite Horizon Undiscounted Setting**:
    *   The paradox highlights the **"mathematical weirdness"** that can arise in the **infinite horizon undiscounted (total reward) setting** of MDPs. In this setting, unlike the discounted case where values are guaranteed to be finite with finitely many states and actions, there's **no guarantee that value functions are well-defined and finite**; they could be minus infinity or positive infinity. The St. Petersburg Paradox demonstrates a scenario where an expectation runs to infinity.
    *   This is why the undiscounted case is described as "quite delicate".

2.  **Necessity for Additional Conditions**:
    *   Because infinite expectations can occur, the undiscounted setting often requires the introduction of **additional conditions** for the value functions to be well-defined and for fundamental theorems to hold.
    *   For example, in the **Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem** (an undiscounted case often framed in terms of costs), conditions such as having "goal states" (absorbing states where no further cost is incurred) and policies being "proper" (reaching a goal state with positive probability from every state), along with non-negative costs, are typically required for the fundamental theorem to be true.

3.  **Bounded Rewards Assumption**:
    *   For MDPs with **infinitely many states and actions**, it becomes necessary to assume that the **reward or cost is bounded** for the Bellman optimality equation and related theorems to hold.
    *   The St. Petersburg Paradox provides a stark example of what happens when rewards are unbounded. If rewards can be unbounded, then costs can "run away," indicating a potential "system breaks" scenario.

4.  **Beyond Expected Value**:
    *   A key lesson from the paradox is that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"**. In scenarios like the St. Petersburg Paradox, relying solely on expected value doesn't account for risk or the practical implications of highly skewed probability distributions. The distribution of returns is "really skewed," with very small probabilities of obtaining very large rewards.

5.  **Understanding Model Imperfections**:
    *   The paradox serves as a reminder that MDP models are **abstractions and imperfect representations** of real-world problems. While mathematical frameworks are useful, we must be aware of their limitations and how they might lead to "awkward" or unrealistic solutions if not applied with caution, especially when dealing with unbounded rewards or infinite horizons.
    *   It highlights that some assumptions, like an "infinite horizon," are mathematical conveniences even though they "will never happen" in reality; they are used because alternatives (like finite horizons) might complicate the analysis (e.g., requiring time-dependent policies) or lead to undesirable system behaviors (like stopping exploration near a deadline). The paradox underscores why some abstract models might not fully capture practical human intuition or real-world constraints.



In the context of understanding Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), several **mathematical "obstructions"** are introduced. These complexities challenge the straightforward application of fundamental theorems and assumptions, ultimately leading to a more profound and nuanced understanding of the field and its limitations.

Here are the key mathematical obstructions discussed and the insights they yield:

*   **The Infinite Horizon Undiscounted Setting and Unbounded Rewards/Costs (The St. Petersburg Paradox)**
    *   **Obstruction**: In the infinite horizon undiscounted setting (where future rewards are not devalued), there is **no guarantee that value functions are well-defined and finite**; they could be minus infinity or positive infinity. The **St. Petersburg Paradox** (also called "the rich paradox the San Peterborough paradox") serves as a prime example of this "mathematical weirdness". In this game, despite an **infinite expected reward** (as the probability of ending on the \(k\)-th trial is \(1/2^k\) and the reward is \(2^{k-1}\), summing to infinity), most people are **unwilling to pay a very large amount** to play, highlighting a disconnect between theoretical expectation and practical risk aversion.
    *   **Understanding Gained**:
        *   It demonstrates that **"just going for the expected return may not be the best thing"** in scenarios where the distribution of returns is "really skewed" with "very small probabilities of very large rewards".
        *   It emphasizes that this setting is **"quite delicate"** and necessitates **additional conditions** for value functions to be well-defined and for fundamental theorems to hold. For example, in the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem (an undiscounted case focused on costs), conditions like having "goal states" (absorbing states with no further cost), "proper policies" (reaching a goal state with positive probability), and non-negative costs are required for the fundamental theorem to be true.
        *   It highlights why, for MDPs with **infinitely many states and actions**, the **reward or cost often needs to be assumed as bounded** for the Bellman optimality equation and related theorems to apply. Unbounded costs can indicate that the "system breaks".

*   **Consideration of Non-Memoryless (History-Dependent) and Non-Stationary Policies**
    *   **Obstruction**: Initially, it's not obvious whether policies that remember past states or actions, or those that change over time (non-stationary), might yield better performance than simpler memoryless (stationary Markov) policies.
    *   **Understanding Gained**: The **Fundamental Theorem of MDPs** addresses this by showing that for discounted MDPs, **optimal value functions are fixed points of the Bellman optimality equation**, and any **greedy policy with respect to the optimal value function is an optimal policy**. Crucially, this theorem proves that **memoryless policies are sufficient for optimality**. This fundamental insight means that if you are in a Markov Decision Process, you **do not have to remember the history to be able to act optimally**. However, defining and understanding this broader class of policies is essential because **learning algorithms inherently produce non-stationary and history-dependent policies** (e.g., updating neural network weights based on past experience). Therefore, to theoretically study and make claims about what learning algorithms can or cannot achieve, one must consider this broader class of policies.

*   **The Finite Horizon Setting**
    *   **Obstruction**: Unlike the infinite horizon discounted case, where optimal policies are stationary, in a finite horizon setting, **optimal actions are not stationary** because they depend on the time remaining (a "deadline effect").
    *   **Understanding Gained**: It reveals that the structure of optimal policies changes with the horizon. While it can be reformulated by adding a time index to the state to regain stationarity, it demonstrates the need for different definitions of value functions (e.g., indexed by time) and often simpler proof techniques like backwards induction.

*   **Stochastic Rewards vs. Deterministic Rewards**
    *   **Obstruction**: While taking expected values allows for mathematically dealing with reward stochasticity in known MDPs, the presence of **genuinely stochastic rewards** can introduce significant complexities, particularly in learning settings where the agent needs to estimate these rewards.
    *   **Understanding Gained**: It highlights that there is a **strong separation in problem hardness** between MDPs with generally stochastic rewards and those with deterministic rewards, influencing algorithm design and theoretical guarantees in reinforcement learning.

*   **Infinite State and Action Spaces**
    *   **Obstruction**: When dealing with infinitely many states and actions, the natural assumption of bounded rewards (which holds for finite state/action spaces in discounted MDPs) is often violated. Costs or rewards can grow unbounded (e.g., in Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems where costs penalize deviation from a target state).
    *   **Understanding Gained**: This necessitates an **explicit assumption of bounded rewards or costs** for many fundamental theorems to remain applicable. It also motivates the use of techniques like **function approximation** to deal with such large spaces, even though boundedness assumptions might still be necessary for simpler analysis.

*   **The Average Reward Setting**
    *   **Obstruction**: This setting can lead to "weird things," such as policies that **delay indefinitely starting to take good actions** without affecting their long-term average reward. This makes it "not trivial" and challenging for theoretical analysis.
    *   **Understanding Gained**: While less favored by some in the RL theory community due to these complexities, it is recognized as having an **interesting structure** and being **practically relevant** for the analysis of online learning algorithms, where it can lead to stronger performance guarantees.

In essence, these mathematical "obstructions" force a deeper dive into the **assumptions underlying MDP models and theorems**. They reveal the **delicacy and unique characteristics of different MDP settings**, emphasize the distinction between theoretical optimality and practical considerations like **risk**, and ultimately underscore that MDPs are **abstractions and imperfect representations** of real-world problems. Understanding these limitations is crucial for appropriately applying the framework.
