Understanding MDPs and Optimal Policies: A Study Guide
I. Core Concepts & Definitions
This section reviews the foundational elements of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and the concepts central to finding optimal behaviors within them.
Markov Decision Process (MDP): A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. It is defined by a five-tuple:
States (S): A set of possible situations the agent can be in.
Actions (A): A set of actions available to the agent in each state.
Transitions (P): Probabilities of moving to a new state given the current state and action. Represented as \(P(s'|s, a)\).
Rewards (R): The immediate reward received after taking an action in a given state and transitioning to a new state. Represented as \(R(s, a, s')\).
Discount Factor (γ): A value between 0 and 1 that discounts future rewards, making immediate rewards more valuable.
Policy (π): A rule that specifies which action to take in each state.
Memoryless Policy: A policy where the action chosen in a state depends only on the current state, not on the history of states or actions. Often denoted as \(\pi(a|s)\).
General Policy: A policy that can depend on the entire history of states, actions, and rewards encountered so far. More powerful, especially in unknown MDPs (learning scenarios).
Value Function (V): A function that quantifies the "goodness" of a state or state-action pair under a given policy.
Value Function of a Policy (Vπ): The expected cumulative discounted reward starting from a state 's' and following policy 'π'. It is a fixed point of the Bellman operator for that policy, \(T_\pi\).
Optimal Value Function (V):* The maximum possible expected cumulative discounted reward achievable from each state. This is the value function of an optimal policy.
Bellman Operators:
Bellman Operator for Policy π (Tπ): An operator that takes a value function 'V' and returns a new value function based on immediate rewards and discounted future rewards under policy π. \(T_\pi V(s) = R_\pi(s) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P_\pi(s,s') V(s')\).
Bellman Optimality Operator (T): An operator that takes a value function 'V' and returns a new value function by maximizing over all possible actions in each state. \(T V(s) = \max_a (R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V(s'))\).
Greedy Policy: A policy that, given a value function V, chooses the action in each state that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value, considering immediate rewards and discounted future values from V. If \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to V, then \(T_\pi V = T V\).
Fixed Point Theorem (Banach Fixed-Point Theorem): States that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and iterating the mapping from any point in the space converges to this fixed point. This theorem is crucial for proving the convergence of Value Iteration.
II. Fundamental Theorem of MDPs
This theorem is a cornerstone for understanding optimality in MDPs. It states two key properties:
Existence of Optimal Memoryless Policy: If a policy \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to the optimal value function \(V^\), then \(\pi\) is an optimal policy, and its value function \(V^\pi\) is equal to \(V^\). This implies that a memoryless policy is sufficient to achieve optimality in finite-state MDPs.
\(V^*\) as a Fixed Point: The optimal value function \(V^\) is the unique fixed point of the Bellman Optimality Operator \(T\). That is, \(V^ = T V^*\).
Proof Outline (as discussed in lecture):
Part 1 (\(V^\pi = V^\) for greedy \(\pi\) w.r.t. \(V^\)):
It's sufficient to show that if \(\pi\) is greedy w.r.t. \(V^\), then \(V^\pi \ge V^\).
Use the monotonicity of Bellman operators (\(T_\pi\) and \(T\)).
Show that for any policy \(\pi'\), \(V^{\pi'} \le T V^\). Taking the supremum over all \(\pi'\) then shows \(V^ \le T V^*\).
For the greedy policy \(\pi\), \(T_\pi V^* = T V^*\).
By repeatedly applying \(T_\pi\) to \(V^\) and using the above inequalities, demonstrate that \(T_\pi^k V^ \ge V^*\).
As \(k \to \infty\), \(T_\pi^k V^\) converges to \(V^\pi\) (by Banach Fixed-Point Theorem), thus \(V^\pi \ge V^\).
Since \(V^\pi \le V^\) by definition, it follows that \(V^\pi = V^\).
Part 2 (\(V^ = T V^*\)):*
From Part 1, we know that if \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(V^\), then \(V^\pi = V^\).
We also know that \(V^\pi\) is a fixed point of \(T_\pi\), i.e., \(V^\pi = T_\pi V^\pi\).
Substituting \(V^\pi = V^\) and using the greediness property (\(T_\pi V^ = T V^\)), we get \(V^ = T V^*\).
III. Algorithms for Finding Optimal Policies
This section compares and contrasts two primary algorithms for solving MDPs: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.
A. Value Iteration (VI)
Goal: To find an approximation of the optimal value function \(V^*\), from which an approximately optimal policy can be derived.
Mechanism: Iteratively applies the Bellman Optimality Operator \(T\) to a current estimate of the value function.
Initialize \(V_0 = 0\) (or any arbitrary vector).
For \(k=0, 1, 2, \dots\): \(V_{k+1} = T V_k\).
Convergence: \(V_k\) converges to \(V^*\) exponentially fast (geometrically fast) due to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, as \(T\) is a contraction mapping.
Computational Cost per Iteration: \(O(S^2A)\) (for dense transitions).
Iteration Complexity (for ε-accuracy): \(K = O(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon(1-\gamma)}))\). This shows a logarithmic dependence on \(\epsilon\), which is "very mild" or "geometrically fast," implying that high accuracy doesn't require a vastly larger number of iterations.
Deriving a Policy: Once \(V_k\) is sufficiently close to \(V^*\), a "near-optimal" policy \(\pi_k\) is obtained by being greedy with respect to \(V_k\).
Performance Guarantee: If \(||V_k - V^||_\infty \le \epsilon\), then the value of the greedy policy \(V^{\pi_k}\) satisfies \(V^{\pi_k} \ge V^ - \frac{2\epsilon}{1-\gamma}\). This implies that the error in the policy's value is inflated by a factor of \(1/(1-\gamma)\) compared to the error in the value function approximation.
Limitations:Does not produce an exactly optimal policy in a finite number of steps (unless lucky).
For exact optimality, it can run indefinitely if there are very small differences in values.
B. Policy Iteration (PI)
Goal: To find an exactly optimal policy.
Mechanism: Alternates between two steps:
Policy Evaluation: For the current policy \(\pi_k\), compute its exact value function \(V^{\pi_k}\). This involves solving a system of linear equations: \(V^{\pi_k} = R_{\pi_k} + \gamma P_{\pi_k} V^{\pi_k} \implies V^{\pi_k} = (I - \gamma P_{\pi_k})^{-1} R_{\pi_k}\). This step typically costs \(O(S^3)\) (matrix inversion) or \(O(S^2)\) to \(O(S^2A)\) (iterative methods).
Policy Improvement: Derive a new policy \(\pi_{k+1}\) by being greedy with respect to \(V^{\pi_k}\). This involves a one-step look-ahead maximization: \(\pi_{k+1}(s) = \arg\max_a (R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V^{\pi_k}(s'))\). This step costs \(O(SA)\).
Convergence:Guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations.
The value functions \(V^{\pi_k}\) are monotonically improving: \(V^{\pi_{k+1}} \ge V^{\pi_k}\).
Iteration Complexity: \(O(\frac{SA}{1-\gamma} \log(\frac{SA}{1-\gamma}))\) or roughly \(O(SA)\) if assuming efficient tie-breaking. This remarkable bound shows no dependence on \(\epsilon\), as it finds an exact optimal policy.
Advantages:Finds an exact optimal policy in a finite number of steps.
Often converges faster in terms of iterations than Value Iteration for exact solutions.
Computational Cost: Typically higher per iteration (\(O(S^3)\) for policy evaluation) but fewer iterations total than VI for exact problems.
IV. Computational Complexity and Lower Bounds
Inherent Complexity of Planning: What is the fundamental computational cost to find optimal or approximately optimal policies in finite MDPs?
Value Iteration (Approximate): Total complexity \(O(S^2 A \cdot \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon(1-\gamma)}))\).
Policy Iteration (Exact): Total complexity \(O(S^3 \cdot \frac{SA}{1-\gamma})\) (if using matrix inversion for policy evaluation).
Lower Bounds: There exist problems where finding an optimal policy requires reading a significant portion of the MDP's transition table. A proposed lower bound is \(O(S^2 A)\) for deterministic policies, implying that in the worst case, one might need to inspect every state-action-next-state possibility to find the optimal path. This highlights the inherent cost of fully understanding an MDP.
The \(1/(1-\gamma)\) Factor: This factor appears in the iteration complexity of both algorithms and represents the "effective horizon" or the number of steps over which rewards significantly influence the value. Whether this factor is truly necessary for all algorithms or if tighter bounds exist (especially for exact solutions) remains an active area of research.
Exact vs. Approximate Solutions: The lecture emphasizes that while exact solutions are theoretically appealing, approximate solutions (from Value Iteration) are often sufficient and more practical given their logarithmic dependence on desired accuracy. The choice depends on the specific application's requirements (e.g., absolute vs. relative error).
State-Independent Computation: A future topic to be explored is whether it's possible to find good actions in a single queried state without necessarily computing the optimal policy for all states, thereby potentially reducing the dependence on \(S\).
V. Monotonicity and Contraction
Monotonicity: Bellman operators (\(T_\pi\) and \(T\)) are monotone, meaning that if \(V_1 \le V_2\) (pointwise), then \(T V_1 \le T V_2\). This property is crucial for many proofs, including the convergence of value iteration and policy iteration's improvement property.
Contraction: The Bellman Optimality Operator \(T\) is a \(\gamma\)-contraction in the max-norm (\(||T V_1 - T V_2||_\infty \le \gamma ||V_1 - V_2||_\infty\)). This property, combined with the completeness of the space of value functions, guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point (Banach Fixed-Point Theorem).
Quiz: MDPs and Optimal Policies
Instructions: Answer each question in 2-3 sentences.
Define a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by listing its five key components. An MDP is a mathematical framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, defined by a five-tuple: states, actions, transition probabilities between states given an action, rewards received for state-action-next state transitions, and a discount factor for future rewards. This tuple formally describes the environment and the agent's interaction with it.
Distinguish between a "memoryless policy" and a "general policy." Why are memoryless policies often preferred in planning problems? A memoryless policy's action choice depends solely on the current state, while a general policy can use the entire history of states and actions. In planning problems where the MDP is fully known, memoryless policies are preferred because the Fundamental Theorem of MDPs proves that a memoryless policy can achieve optimality, simplifying representation and computation without loss of performance.
What does the "Fundamental Theorem of MDPs" state about the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) and greedy policies? The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs states two main things: first, that if a policy is greedy with respect to \(V^\), it is an optimal policy itself. Second, it states that \(V^\) is the unique fixed point of the Bellman Optimality Operator (\(T V^* = V^*\)).
Briefly explain the role of the "Bellman Optimality Operator (T)" in the context of MDPs. The Bellman Optimality Operator (T) is a crucial mathematical tool that takes a value function and returns an improved one by performing a one-step look-ahead maximization over all possible actions. Its fixed point is the optimal value function (\(V^*\)), which represents the maximum achievable discounted reward from any state.
How does Value Iteration compute the optimal value function? What property guarantees its convergence? Value Iteration computes the optimal value function by iteratively applying the Bellman Optimality Operator (\(T\)) to an initial value function estimate. Its convergence to the unique optimal value function is guaranteed by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, as the Bellman Optimality Operator is a contraction mapping.
What is the "iteration complexity" of Value Iteration, and what does its dependence on \(\epsilon\) signify? The iteration complexity of Value Iteration for achieving \(\epsilon\)-accuracy is logarithmic in \(1/\epsilon\), specifically \(O(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon(1-\gamma)}))\). This logarithmic dependence on \(\epsilon\) indicates a geometric or "very fast" rate of convergence, meaning that achieving higher accuracy (smaller \(\epsilon\)) does not require a disproportionately larger number of iterations.
Describe the two main steps involved in each iteration of Policy Iteration. Each iteration of Policy Iteration involves two steps: Policy Evaluation and Policy Improvement. In Policy Evaluation, the exact value function for the current policy is computed (often by solving a system of linear equations). In Policy Improvement, a new policy is derived by being greedy with respect to the value function just computed.
What is a significant advantage of Policy Iteration over Value Iteration, particularly concerning the type of policy found? A significant advantage of Policy Iteration over Value Iteration is that it is guaranteed to find an exactly optimal policy in a finite number of iterations. In contrast, Value Iteration typically produces an approximately optimal value function and thus an approximately optimal policy, never achieving exact optimality in a finite number of steps for all cases.
Explain the meaning of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor that frequently appears in the computational complexity bounds for MDP algorithms. The \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor represents the "effective horizon" of the discounted MDP, which is roughly the number of steps over which future rewards significantly influence the current value function. A larger discount factor (gamma closer to 1) implies a longer effective horizon and thus a greater number of iterations or computations required.
Why are Value Iteration and Policy Iteration proofs often reliant on "monotonicity" and "contraction" properties? These proofs rely on monotonicity to show that improvements or bounds in value functions are preserved through Bellman operator applications. Contraction (specifically of the Bellman Optimality Operator) ensures that iterative applications converge to a unique fixed point, providing a strong mathematical guarantee for the algorithms' convergence to the optimal value function.
Quiz Answer Key
Define a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by listing its five key components. An MDP is defined by its five components: a set of states (S), a set of actions (A), transition probabilities (P) indicating the likelihood of moving to a new state given a state-action pair, a reward function (R) specifying immediate rewards, and a discount factor (γ) that weights future rewards. Together, these elements describe the environment and how an agent interacts with it to maximize cumulative reward.
Distinguish between a "memoryless policy" and a "general policy." Why are memoryless policies often preferred in planning problems? A memoryless policy determines actions based only on the current state, whereas a general policy can use the entire history of observations. In planning problems where the MDP model is known, memoryless policies are preferred because the Fundamental Theorem of MDPs guarantees that an optimal policy can always be memoryless, simplifying computation and representation without sacrificing optimality.
What does the "Fundamental Theorem of MDPs" state about the optimal value function (\(V^*\)) and greedy policies? The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs states two critical points: first, a policy that is greedy with respect to the optimal value function (\(V^\)) is itself an optimal policy. Second, \(V^\) is the unique fixed point of the Bellman Optimality Operator (\(T\)), meaning \(V^* = T V^*\).
Briefly explain the role of the "Bellman Optimality Operator (T)" in the context of MDPs. The Bellman Optimality Operator (T) is an operator that transforms a value function by considering the maximum possible expected one-step reward plus discounted future value for each state. Its unique fixed point is the optimal value function (\(V^*\)), making it central to algorithms that aim to discover the best possible long-term rewards.
How does Value Iteration compute the optimal value function? What property guarantees its convergence? Value Iteration computes the optimal value function by iteratively applying the Bellman Optimality Operator (T) to an initial value function estimate, \(V_{k+1} = T V_k\). Its convergence to the unique optimal value function (\(V^*\)) is guaranteed by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, as the Bellman Optimality Operator is a contraction mapping.
What is the "iteration complexity" of Value Iteration, and what does its dependence on \(\epsilon\) signify? The iteration complexity of Value Iteration for achieving \(\epsilon\)-accuracy is logarithmic in \(1/\epsilon\). This dependence implies a geometric rate of convergence, meaning that the number of iterations required grows very slowly with increasing desired precision, making it efficient for obtaining high approximate accuracy.
Describe the two main steps involved in each iteration of Policy Iteration. Each iteration of Policy Iteration comprises two main steps: Policy Evaluation and Policy Improvement. In Policy Evaluation, the exact value function for the current policy is computed. Subsequently, in Policy Improvement, a new, potentially better policy is derived by choosing actions greedily with respect to the evaluated value function.
What is a significant advantage of Policy Iteration over Value Iteration, particularly concerning the type of policy found? A significant advantage of Policy Iteration is its guarantee to converge to an exactly optimal policy in a finite number of iterations. In contrast, Value Iteration typically yields an approximately optimal policy, and finding an exact optimal policy through Value Iteration might require an indefinite number of iterations due to the nature of its convergence.
Explain the meaning of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor that frequently appears in the computational complexity bounds for MDP algorithms. The \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor, often termed the "effective horizon," represents the typical number of time steps over which future rewards significantly contribute to the current state's value due to discounting. A larger value of gamma (closer to 1) means a longer effective horizon, leading to more iterations or computations needed to capture long-term effects.
Why are Value Iteration and Policy Iteration proofs often reliant on "monotonicity" and "contraction" properties? Proofs for Value Iteration and Policy Iteration heavily rely on monotonicity to show that improvements to value functions are preserved through Bellman operator applications. Contraction, specifically that the Bellman optimality operator shrinks differences in value functions, ensures that the iterative processes converge to a unique and correct solution.

2. What are the three main topics discussed in this lecture?
The lecture focuses on three core topics:
Recap and computational questions: This section reviews fundamental concepts of MDPs, policies (memoryless vs. general), and the Bellman optimality operator. It also delves into value iteration and its computational cost in finding approximately optimal policies.
Policy iteration: This introduces an alternative algorithm that is often faster than value iteration in terms of iteration complexity. It has the distinct advantage of being able to terminate and find an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations, without approximations.
Inherent computational complexity of planning in finite MDPs: This section discusses the theoretical limits of finding optimal or approximately optimal policies, including lower bounds for computational complexity and the potential for algorithmic improvements.
3. What is the Fundamental Theorem in the context of MDPs, and why is it important?
The Fundamental Theorem states two crucial points regarding optimal policies and value functions:
If a memoryless policy is "greedy" with respect to the optimal value function (v*), then this policy is itself optimal. This means that if you know v*, you can directly derive an optimal policy by choosing actions that maximize the immediate reward plus the discounted future value from v*.
The optimal value function (v*) is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator. This implies that v* satisfies a specific self-consistency equation, which is fundamental to many reinforcement learning algorithms.
The theorem is important because it provides a theoretical bridge between finding the optimal value function and deriving an optimal policy, simplifying the problem of policy optimization.
4. How does Value Iteration work, and what are its computational properties?
Value Iteration is an algorithm used to approximate the optimal value function (v*). It starts with an arbitrary initial value function (often all zeros) and iteratively updates it by applying the Bellman optimality operator. This process is guaranteed to converge to v* exponentially fast.
The computational cost of each iteration is proportional to SA (number of states times number of actions), as it involves calculations for every state and action. For achieving an epsilon-accurate estimate of v, the number of iterations required has a mild logarithmic dependence on 1/epsilon. This "geometric rate" means that it is not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy. However, Value Iteration is generally not suitable for finding exact optimal policies, as it can take arbitrarily long to close very small gaps in value differences.
5. How does Policy Iteration differ from Value Iteration, and what are its advantages?
Policy Iteration is another algorithm that aims to find an optimal policy. Unlike Value Iteration, which iteratively updates the value function directly, Policy Iteration alternates between two steps:
Policy Evaluation: For the current policy, calculate its exact value function (v_pi). This often involves solving a system of linear equations.
Policy Improvement: Based on v_pi, derive a new, greedy policy that is guaranteed to be as good as or better than the previous one.
A key advantage of Policy Iteration is that it can terminate after a finite number of iterations (specifically, polynomial in S, A, and 1/(1-gamma)) and output an exactly optimal policy, without approximations. This contrasts with Value Iteration, which is typically used for approximate solutions. Policy Iteration is often at least as fast as Value Iteration in terms of iteration complexity and is particularly powerful for finding precise optimal solutions.
6. What is the "effective horizon" in discounted MDPs, and why is it significant?
The "effective horizon" refers to the number of iterations required for Value Iteration to reach a certain level of accuracy. For a discounted problem, it is approximately proportional to log(1/epsilon) / log(1/gamma), where epsilon is the desired error tolerance and gamma is the discount factor. This quantity signifies how many steps into the future are relevant for decision-making given the discount rate.
It is significant because it provides a practical bound on the number of iterations needed for Value Iteration. Furthermore, if you greedify a value function that is epsilon-close to the optimal, the resulting policy's value function will be near-optimal up to a factor of epsilon / (1 - gamma). This means that the error in the policy value is amplified by 1/(1-gamma), highlighting the importance of the discount factor in the overall performance.
7. What are the current understanding and open questions regarding the computational complexity of planning in finite MDPs?
The current understanding suggests a lower bound for finding an optimal policy of at least S * A (states times actions), implying that one must at least inspect all state-action pairs. For Policy Iteration, the computational complexity is roughly S^3 * A / (1 - gamma) per iteration, or S^2 * A if using matrix inversion, multiplied by S*A / (1 - gamma) iterations.
A major open question is whether the 1/(1-gamma) dependence in the complexity bounds is truly necessary for exact calculations, particularly when the number of states is small. While there are procedures whose running time is independent of 1/(1-gamma) for a fixed number of states, the interaction between the number of states (S) and the effective planning horizon (1/(1-gamma)) remains a delicate area of research. For approximate calculations, the log(1/epsilon) dependence in Value Iteration is often considered acceptable.
8. Why is it often sufficient to find "approximately optimal" policies rather than "exactly optimal" ones?
While algorithms like Policy Iteration can find exactly optimal policies, in many real-world scenarios, it is sufficient, and often more practical, to find approximately optimal policies. The reasons include:
Computational Cost: Exact calculations can be significantly more computationally expensive, especially when the discount factor is close to 1 (leading to a very large 1/(1-gamma) factor) or the number of states and actions is very large.
Practical Needs: In many applications, a small absolute error in the value function might be acceptable, especially if the maximum possible reward is high. For instance, an absolute error of epsilon=1 might be fine if optimal values are in the hundreds or thousands.
Sensitivity to Error Definitions: The definition of "approximate" matters. An absolute error bond (epsilon) might be acceptable, but a small relative error often requires computations almost as complex as finding an exact solution.
Ultimately, the choice between exact and approximate calculations depends on the specific problem's requirements, the tolerance for error, and the available computational resources.


Value iteration is a fundamental algorithm used to find an approximately optimal policy in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) ``. It operates by iteratively computing value functions that converge to the optimal value function `v*` ``.

Here's a detailed breakdown of value iteration and its aspects:

*   **How Value Iteration Works**
    *   **Initialization:** You start with an arbitrary initialization for the value function, typically `v0` set to zero ``. It's generally recommended to initialize `v0` within the range `[0, 1/(1-gamma)]` if rewards are normalized ``.
    *   **Iterative Update:** The algorithm proceeds by applying the **Bellman optimality operator** (`T`) to the previous iterate to compute the next one ``. This is represented as `vk+1 = T(vk)` ``.
        *   The `T` operator maximizes over possible actions `a` for each state. For a given state, it calculates the immediate reward `R` plus the discounted (`gamma`) expected future value `P(s'|s,a) * V(s')` for all possible next states `s'` ``.
        *   This iterative computation has a **finite cost** for each state, involving summing over states for each action and then performing a maximization ``.

*   **Convergence and Accuracy**
    *   **Fixed Point Theorem:** Value iteration's convergence is guaranteed by the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem** ``. The `T` operator is a contraction mapping in a complete norm space (like Euclidean spaces with the max norm), meaning it has a unique fixed point ``. This fixed point is the optimal value function `v*` ``.
    *   **Geometric Rate:** The sequence of value functions `vk` generated by value iteration converges to `v*` **exponentially fast** or at a **geometric rate** ``.
    *   **Error Bound:** The error between the current iterate `vk` and the optimal value function `v*` is bounded. If rewards are in ``, then `v*` is bounded by `1/(1-gamma)` ``. The error `||vk - v*||max` is at most `gamma^k * ||v*||max`, which can be further bounded by `gamma^k / (1-gamma)` ``.
    *   **Iteration Complexity for Epsilon Accuracy:** To achieve an `epsilon`-accurate estimate of `v*` (i.e., `||vk - v*||max < epsilon`), the number of iterations `k` required is given by `log(1/epsilon) / log(1/gamma)` (approximately) ``. This quantity is often referred to as the **epsilon horizon** ``. The dependence on `epsilon` is **mild** (`log(1/epsilon)`) ``, meaning the algorithm is not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy.

*   **Deriving an Approximately Optimal Policy**
    *   The ultimate goal is not just to compute `v*`, but to find a **near-optimal policy** ``.
    *   **Greedification:** Once an approximate value function `v` (e.g., `vk`) is obtained from value iteration, a policy `pi` is derived by **greedifying** with respect to `v` ``. This means that for each state, the policy `pi` chooses the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value using the approximated `v` ``.
    *   **Near-Optimality Guarantee:** If the obtained value function `v` is `epsilon`-close to `v*` (i.e., `||v - v*||max <= epsilon`), then the policy `pi` that is greedy with respect to `v` will be **near-optimal** ``. Specifically, its value function `v_pi` will be at least `v* - (epsilon / (1-gamma))` ``. This implies that the error of the policy `||v_pi - v*||max` is bounded by `epsilon / (1-gamma)` ``.
    *   **Adjusting Accuracy Target:** To achieve an `epsilon`-optimal policy, `vk` must be computed to a higher precision, specifically `(1-gamma) * epsilon`-close to `v*` ``. This adjusts the number of iterations needed for `vk`.

*   **Computational Aspects**
    *   **Cost Per Iteration:** Each iteration of value iteration typically costs `O(S^2 * A)` where `S` is the number of states and `A` is the number of actions ``. This is because for every state `S`, for every action `A`, you need to consider transitions to `S` next states.
    *   **Total Computational Complexity:** Combining the cost per iteration with the number of iterations required, the total computational complexity of value iteration to obtain an `epsilon`-optimal policy is approximately `O(S^2 * A * (log(1/((1-gamma)epsilon)) / log(1/gamma)))` ``. This means it has a **logarithmic dependence on `1/epsilon`** and a **`1/(1-gamma)` dependence** ``.

*   **Limitations**
    *   Value iteration is **not well-suited for finding exact optimal policies** because it might require an arbitrarily large amount of time to close infinitesimally small gaps in value differences, potentially running indefinitely ``.
    *   It is primarily designed for and performs well in **approximate calculations** ``. The question of what `epsilon` is acceptable depends on the specific problem; an absolute error `epsilon` might be fine if optimal values are large ``. Achieving small relative errors, however, is much harder and often requires calculations closer to exact methods ``.

In contrast to policy iteration, which can find an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations without approximations and is at least as fast in terms of iteration complexity ``, value iteration's strength lies in its ability to quickly provide good approximate solutions.

Policy iteration is a curious and powerful algorithm used to find an optimal policy in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Unlike value iteration, it has the property that it can terminate and find an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations without needing approximations.

### How Policy Iteration Works

Policy iteration works by iteratively improving a policy until it becomes optimal. It typically starts with an arbitrarily chosen memoryless policy, `pi_0`. Each iteration involves two main steps:

1.  **Policy Evaluation:** Calculate the **value function of the current policy** `v_pi_k`. For any memoryless policy, its value function `v_pi_k` is the unique fixed point of the Bellman operator for that policy, `T_pi_k`. This can be calculated directly by solving a linear equation: `v_pi_k = (I - gamma * P_pi_k)^-1 * R_pi_k`. This involves inverting an `S x S` matrix, where `S` is the number of states, which is a finite computation. While an iterative approach (applying `T_pi_k` multiple times) could be used to *approximately* solve this, policy iteration typically aims for an *exact* solution for `v_pi_k`.
2.  **Policy Improvement (Greedification):** Generate a **new policy** `pi_k+1` by **greedifying with respect to the value function** `v_pi_k` just calculated. This means that for each state, the new policy `pi_k+1` selects the action `a` that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value using `v_pi_k`. If ties occur when choosing the maximizing action, they should be resolved in a systematic fashion (e.g., always choosing the action with the lowest index).

### Properties in MDPs

*   **Convergence and Optimality:** Policy iteration is guaranteed to **converge to an optimal policy** in a finite number of iterations. It explicitly outputs an optimal policy, without requiring approximations.
*   **Comparison to Value Iteration:** Policy iteration is **always at least as fast in terms of its iteration complexity as value iteration**.
*   **Improvement Guarantee:** If you start with a non-optimal policy, it can be proven that after a certain number of iterations (roughly `log(S*A / (1-gamma))`), there will exist at least one state for which the action chosen by the initial policy will *never* be chosen again by subsequent policies generated by the algorithm. This effectively means that "bad" actions for certain states are eliminated over time.
*   **Deterministic Policies:** The discussion often assumes deterministic policies, which simplifies the conceptualization of eliminating "bad" actions.

### Computational Aspects

*   **Cost Per Iteration:**
    *   Calculating `v_pi_k` (policy evaluation) by matrix inversion costs approximately `O(S^3)` operations, or `O(S^2.3...)` with more advanced matrix multiplication algorithms.
    *   Greedification (policy improvement) costs `O(S * A)`.
    *   Therefore, the **cost per iteration is dominated by the matrix inversion step**, roughly `O(S^3)`.
*   **Total Computational Complexity:** The total computational complexity to obtain an optimal policy is approximately `O(S^3 * (S*A / (1-gamma)))` if using matrix inversion, or `O(S^2 * A * (S*A / (1-gamma)))`. The `(S*A / (1-gamma))` term represents the number of iterations.
*   **Dependence on Discount Factor (gamma):** The number of iterations required has a `1/(1-gamma)` dependence, which is a quantity that appears frequently in MDP analysis.
*   **Lower Bounds and Practical Considerations:**
    *   For finding *exact* optimal policies, the best known lower bound for computational complexity is `O(S^2 * A)`. This implies that there might be a gap between the theoretical performance of policy iteration (which can have `S^3` or higher factors) and the fundamental limits of the problem.
    *   However, if the number of states (`S`) is small and fixed, one could theoretically enumerate all `A^S` deterministic policies and calculate their values to find the optimal one, and this procedure's running time would be independent of `1/(1-gamma)`. This suggests that the dependence on `1/(1-gamma)` is more critical when the number of states is large relative to the planning horizon.
    *   Policy iteration is well-suited for **exact optimal policy calculations**, whereas value iteration is not, as it might take an arbitrarily long time to close infinitesimally small value gaps. The decision of whether to pursue an exact solution versus an approximate one often depends on the specific problem and whether absolute or relative errors are of greater concern.


To find optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), two primary algorithms are discussed: **Value Iteration** and **Policy Iteration**. While both aim to find good policies, they differ in their approach and whether they yield an approximately optimal or exactly optimal solution.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to find optimal policies using these methods:

### 1. Value Iteration: For Approximately Optimal Policies

Value iteration is used to find an **approximately optimal policy** by iteratively computing value functions that converge to the optimal value function `v*`.

*   **How it Works:**
    *   **Initialization:** You typically start with an arbitrary initialization for the value function, often `v0` set to zero. It's generally recommended to initialize `v0` within the range `[0, 1/(1-gamma)]` if rewards are normalized.
    *   **Iterative Update:** The algorithm proceeds by applying the **Bellman optimality operator** (`T`) to the previous value function estimate to compute the next one: `vk+1 = T(vk)`.
        *   The `T` operator involves maximizing over possible actions for each state, calculating the immediate reward plus the discounted expected future value.
        *   This iterative computation has a **finite cost** for each state.
    *   **Convergence:** The sequence of value functions `vk` generated by value iteration converges to `v*` **exponentially fast** or at a **geometric rate**. This convergence is guaranteed by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, as the `T` operator is a contraction mapping.
    *   **Error Bound:** The error `||vk - v*||max` is bounded by `gamma^k / (1-gamma)` if rewards are normalized (e.g., between 0 and 1).

*   **Deriving an Approximately Optimal Policy:**
    *   The ultimate goal is to compute a **near-optimal policy**.
    *   **Greedification:** Once an approximate value function `v` (e.g., `vk`) is obtained from value iteration, a policy `pi` is derived by **greedifying with respect to `v`**. This means that for each state, the policy `pi` chooses the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value using the approximated `v`.
    *   **Near-Optimality Guarantee:** If the obtained value function `v` is `epsilon`-close to `v*` (i.e., `||v - v*||max <= epsilon`), then the policy `pi` that is greedy with respect to `v` will be **near-optimal**. Specifically, its value function `v_pi` will be at least `v* - (epsilon / (1-gamma))`. This implies that to achieve an `epsilon`-optimal policy, `vk` must be computed to a higher precision, specifically `(1-gamma) * epsilon`-close to `v*`.

*   **Computational Aspects:**
    *   **Cost Per Iteration:** Each iteration costs approximately `O(S^2 * A)`, where `S` is the number of states and `A` is the number of actions. This is because for every state, a calculation that considers all actions and their transitions to other states must be performed.
    *   **Total Computational Complexity:** To obtain an `epsilon`-optimal policy, the total complexity is approximately `O(S^2 * A * (log(1/((1-gamma)epsilon)) / log(1/gamma)))`. This shows a **mild logarithmic dependence on `1/epsilon`** and a `1/(1-gamma)` dependence.
    *   **Limitations:** Value iteration is **not well-suited for finding exact optimal policies** because it might require an arbitrarily large amount of time to close infinitesimally small gaps in value differences, potentially running indefinitely. It performs well in **approximate calculations**.

### 2. Policy Iteration: For Exactly Optimal Policies

Policy iteration is a powerful algorithm specifically designed to find an **optimal policy** in MDPs.

*   **How it Works:** Policy iteration works by iteratively improving a policy until it becomes optimal. It typically starts with an arbitrarily chosen memoryless policy, `pi_0`. Each iteration involves two main steps:
    1.  **Policy Evaluation:** Calculate the **value function of the current policy** `v_pi_k`. For any memoryless policy, its value function `v_pi_k` is the unique fixed point of its Bellman operator `T_pi_k`. This can be calculated directly by **solving a linear equation**: `v_pi_k = (I - gamma * P_pi_k)^-1 * R_pi_k`. This step often involves inverting an `S x S` matrix.
    2.  **Policy Improvement (Greedification):** Generate a **new policy** `pi_k+1` by **greedifying with respect to the value function** `v_pi_k` just calculated. This means that for each state, the new policy `pi_k+1` selects the action `a` that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value using `v_pi_k`. Resolving ties in a systematic fashion (e.g., always choosing the action with the lowest index) is important.

*   **Properties in MDPs:**
    *   **Convergence and Optimality:** Policy iteration is **guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy** in a **finite number of iterations**. It explicitly outputs an optimal policy, without requiring approximations.
    *   **Improvement Guarantee:** The algorithm ensures that "bad" actions for certain states are eliminated over time. If the policy doesn't change between iterations, an optimal policy has been found.
    *   **Comparison to Value Iteration:** Policy iteration is **always at least as fast in terms of its iteration complexity as value iteration**.

*   **Computational Aspects:**
    *   **Cost Per Iteration:** The policy evaluation step, which often involves matrix inversion, **dominates the cost per iteration**, approximately `O(S^3)` operations, or `O(S^2.3...)` with more advanced matrix multiplication algorithms. The greedification step costs `O(S * A)`.
    *   **Total Computational Complexity:** The total computational complexity to obtain an optimal policy is approximately `O(S^3 * (S*A / (1-gamma)))` if using matrix inversion, or `O(S^2 * A * (S*A / (1-gamma)))`. The number of iterations required has a `poly(S, A, 1/(1-gamma))` dependence (specifically, `S*A / (1-gamma)` iterations).
    *   **No `log(1/epsilon)` Dependence:** A notable difference from value iteration is that policy iteration does not have a `log(1/epsilon)` dependence because it seeks an exact solution, not an approximate one.

In summary, while **Value Iteration** is computationally efficient for providing **approximate optimal policies**, **Policy Iteration** is guaranteed to find **exact optimal policies** in a finite number of iterations, often at a higher computational cost per iteration due to matrix operations. The choice between the two often depends on whether an exact or approximate solution is required for the specific problem.


The computational complexity of planning in finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is a central question in reinforcement learning theory, specifically focusing on how expensive it is to compute optimal or approximately optimal policies. The sources discuss this in the context of two main algorithms: Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, and also touch upon theoretical lower bounds.

### Computational Complexity of Value Iteration

Value Iteration aims to find an **approximately optimal policy** by iteratively computing value functions that converge to the optimal value function `v*`.

*   **Cost Per Iteration**: Each iteration of Value Iteration costs approximately **O(S² * A)** operations. This is because, for every state, calculations considering all actions and their transitions to other states must be performed, along with discounting and rewards, and then a maximization step.
*   **Total Computational Complexity for Epsilon-Optimality**: To obtain an `epsilon`-optimal policy (meaning the policy's value function is `epsilon`-close to `v*`), the total complexity is approximately **O(S² * A * (log(1/((1-gamma)epsilon)) / log(1/gamma)))**.
    *   This shows a **mild logarithmic dependence on `1/epsilon`**, often referred to as a geometric rate of convergence, meaning it's not highly sensitive to the desired accuracy.
    *   There is also a **`1/(1-gamma)` dependence**, a quantity that frequently appears in MDP analysis.
    *   Specifically, to achieve an `epsilon`-optimal policy, the value function `v_k` must be computed to a higher precision of `(1-gamma) * epsilon`-close to `v*`. This implies that if `v_k` is `epsilon`-close to `v*`, the greedy policy derived from `v_k` will be `epsilon/(1-gamma)`-optimal.
*   **Limitations**: Value Iteration is **not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies**. It might require an arbitrarily long time to close infinitesimally small value gaps, potentially running indefinitely. It excels in approximate calculations.

### Computational Complexity of Policy Iteration

Policy Iteration is a "curious" algorithm that is designed to find an **exactly optimal policy** in MDPs.

*   **Cost Per Iteration**:
    *   The Policy Evaluation step, where the value function `v_pi_k` of the current policy `pi_k` is calculated, involves **solving a system of linear equations**. This can be done by **matrix inversion**, which costs approximately **O(S³)** operations (or `O(S^2.3...)` with more advanced algorithms) for an S x S matrix.
    *   The Policy Improvement (greedification) step costs **O(S * A)**.
    *   Therefore, the **cost per iteration is typically dominated by the matrix inversion step, roughly O(S³)**.
*   **Total Computational Complexity**: Policy Iteration is guaranteed to **terminate and output an optimal policy in a finite number of iterations**.
    *   The iteration bound for Policy Iteration is approximately **poly(S, A, 1/(1-gamma))**, or more precisely **S * A / (1-gamma) iterations**.
    *   This means the total computational complexity can be roughly **O(S³ * (S * A / (1-gamma)))**.
    *   A key distinction is that Policy Iteration has **no `log(1/epsilon)` dependence** because it yields an exact optimal policy, not an approximation.
*   **Speed Comparison**: Policy Iteration is "always at least as fast in terms of its iteration complexity as value iteration".

### Inherent Computational Complexity (Lower Bounds)

The discussion of computational complexity also raises questions about the inherent lower bounds of finding optimal policies in finite MDPs.

*   **Lower Bound**: The best-known lower bound for computing an *exact* optimal policy is **O(S² * A)**. This lower bound is derived from problems where, to determine the optimal action in every state, one essentially needs to "read" or process information related to all state-action pairs.
*   **Gap and `1/(1-gamma)` Dependence**: There appears to be a gap between the theoretical lower bound (O(S² * A)) and the complexity of Policy Iteration (which can have `S³` or `S⁴` factors and a `1/(1-gamma)` dependence). This gap suggests there might be room for improvement in algorithms.
    *   The constant `1/(1-gamma)` appears frequently, and it's an "open question" whether this dependence is strictly necessary for exact calculations.
*   **Fixed Number of States**: If the number of states (S) is small and fixed, one could theoretically enumerate all `A^S` deterministic policies and calculate their values to find the optimal one. In this specific scenario, the running time of such a procedure would be **independent of `1/(1-gamma)`**. This suggests that the dependence on `1/(1-gamma)` becomes more critical when the number of states is large relative to the "planning horizon" (which `1/(1-gamma)` represents).

### Practical Considerations

Ultimately, the choice of algorithm and the acceptable level of complexity often depend on whether an **exact or approximate calculation** is required.

*   For many practical applications, **approximate calculations are often sufficient** and are preferred due to the "mild logarithmic dependence" on `1/epsilon` in value iteration.
*   The exactness of Policy Iteration means it is used when precise optimal policies are strictly needed.
*   The type of error (absolute vs. relative) also influences the needed precision; relative errors can be much harder to keep small and approach the complexity of exact calculations.


The computational complexity of planning in finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) also involves understanding the **inherent lower bounds** of what is theoretically possible for any algorithm to achieve, in addition to the upper bounds provided by specific algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.

Here's a breakdown of the lower bounds and the relevant discussion:

*   **The Best Known Lower Bound**
    *   The best-known lower bound for computing an **exact optimal policy** is approximately **O(S * A)**. This is presented as "S grad A" or "square a".
    *   **Justification:** This lower bound stems from problems where, to determine the optimal action in every state, one essentially needs to "read" or process information related to all state-action pairs. An illustrative example involves `S-2` states, with `A` actions in each state, where an action can lead to either a "heaven" (rewarding) or "hell" (no reward) state. To find the optimal action (the one leading to heaven), one needs to "read the whole table" of state-action transitions, which means checking all `S * A` state-action pairs. This reading process implies a computational cost proportional to `S * A`.

*   **The Gap Between Lower Bounds and Algorithm Complexities**
    *   There is a notable **gap between the theoretical lower bound of O(S * A) and the complexities of the currently known algorithms** for finding optimal policies.
    *   For instance, Policy Iteration, which yields an exact optimal policy, can have a per-iteration cost of O(S³) (due to matrix inversion) and a total complexity that can be roughly O(S³ * (S * A / (1-gamma))). Value Iteration, while suitable for approximations, has a total complexity of O(S² * A * (log(1/((1-gamma)epsilon)) / log(1/gamma))). The existence of this gap suggests there might be **"room for improvement" in algorithms**.

*   **The Intriguing `1/(1-gamma)` Dependence**
    *   A critical aspect of the discussion around lower bounds is the **`1/(1-gamma)` factor** that frequently appears in the complexity analyses of algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. Policy Iteration, for example, is bounded by `S * A / (1-gamma)` iterations.
    *   However, this `1/(1-gamma)` dependence is **absent from the best-known lower bound**. This leads to an **"open question"** regarding whether this dependence is strictly necessary for exact calculations.
    *   **Contextual Dependence:** If the number of states (S) is small and fixed, one could theoretically enumerate all `A^S` deterministic policies and calculate their values to find the optimal one. In this specific scenario, the running time of such a procedure would be **independent of `1/(1-gamma)`**. This suggests that the dependence on `1/(1-gamma)` (which represents the "planning horizon") becomes more critical when the number of states is large relative to this horizon.

*   **Exact vs. Approximate Calculations**
    *   The lower bound of O(S * A) specifically applies to computing an **exact optimal policy**.
    *   Value Iteration is generally **not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies**, as it might require an arbitrarily long time to close infinitesimally small value gaps, potentially running indefinitely. It is highly effective for obtaining **approximately optimal policies** due to its mild logarithmic dependence on `1/epsilon`.
    *   The choice between pursuing an exact or approximate calculation often depends on practical requirements, as approximate calculations are frequently sufficient and computationally more feasible. Keeping relative errors small, however, can approach the complexity of exact calculations.

In summary, while algorithms like Policy Iteration can find exact optimal policies in finite time, and Value Iteration can find approximate ones efficiently, the fundamental lower bound suggests that solving the planning problem inherently requires at least processing information proportional to the number of state-action pairs. The `1/(1-gamma)` factor remains a subject of ongoing research regarding its necessity for exact computations.


Based on the sources, policies in the context of finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be broadly categorized into two main types: **general policies** and **memoryless policies**.

Here are the different types of policies discussed:

*   **Memoryless Policies**:
    *   These policies are characterized by having a **compact description**.
    *   They "just assign a property distribution to every state". This implies that the action chosen at any given state depends only on the current state itself, not on the history of states, actions, or rewards that led to it.
    *   A **greedy policy** is, by definition, a **memoryless policy**. Such a policy selects actions that maximize the one-step look-ahead under a given value function.
    *   The discussion on Policy Iteration in the context of an action table assumes the use of **deterministic policies**. While not explicitly defined as a distinct category, deterministic policies are a type of memoryless policy where a specific action (rather than a probability distribution over actions) is chosen for each state. The source implies that considering non-deterministic policies is "unnecessary" in this setting.

*   **General Policies**:
    *   These policies are considered potentially **much more powerful** than memoryless policies, especially in scenarios like learning within an MDP.
    *   They "use all the information that you received so far to come up with a decision about what action to take next". This means they can consider the **entire history** of states, actions, and possibly rewards when making a decision.
    *   However, in the context of **planning problems**, the reward is typically not included in the history used by policies, as the reward is simply given to the policy and the problem focuses on whether past information (excluding rewards) can improve decision-making.

The fundamental theorem mentioned in the lecture clarifies that, for planning problems, even if policies are allowed to use history, a greedy policy with respect to the optimal value function (`v*`), which is a memoryless policy, will still be an optimal policy.


In the context of planning problems within Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the discussion of **rewards is approached differently than in learning problems**.

Here's why rewards are typically not explicitly discussed as part of the policy's "history" in planning problems:

*   **Reward is Given to the Policy**: In planning, the problem setup assumes that **the reward is "just given to this policy"**. This means the agent inherently knows or receives the reward associated with a state-action transition.
*   **Focus on Using Past Information (Excluding Rewards)**: The core question in planning, particularly when considering different types of policies, is **"whether you could do better if you allowed policies to use the history"**. This history primarily refers to past states and actions, not the rewards themselves. The reward "doesn't really matter" in this specific context because it's an output or feedback given to the policy, not information that the policy needs to process from its past experiences to make a future decision.
*   **Contrast with Learning Problems**: The sources note that **general policies** are "much more powerful" in **learning scenarios** where the MDP is unknown. In such cases, if the reward is also unknown, policies *would* "need to put the reward also into the information that you're basing your decision on on what action to take". However, **planning assumes knowledge of the MDP**, including its reward structure.
*   **The Fundamental Theorem's Implication**: The fundamental theorem discussed in the lecture clarifies that for planning, even if policies were allowed to use history, a **memoryless policy that is greedy with respect to the optimal value function (`v*`) will still be an optimal policy**. This implies that for finding an optimal policy in planning problems, incorporating the history of rewards (or even states/actions beyond the current state) into the policy's decision-making is **unnecessary**.



We have discussed the lower bounds of algorithms and the types of policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), along with the role of rewards in planning problems. Drawing on the sources, here are some nuanced insights that we have not yet mentioned in our conversation:

*   **The Nature of Value Iteration's Convergence and Error Propagation:**
    *   Value Iteration (VI) converges to the optimal value function (\(v^*\)) at an **exponentially fast, or geometric rate**. This means its dependence on the desired accuracy (\(\epsilon\)) is "very mild" due to the `log(1/epsilon)` term, making it "not too sensitive to the desired accuracy".
    *   However, a crucial practical nuance is that if you obtain a value function \(v_k\) that is \(\epsilon\)-close to \(v^*\), the policy you derive by greedifying \(v_k\) will only be **\(\epsilon / (1-\gamma)\) near-optimal**. This implies that the initial \(\epsilon\) for the value function approximation needs to be "pre-inflated" by a factor of \((1-\gamma)\) to achieve the desired policy optimality, as errors propagate and scale with the effective planning horizon.
    *   Furthermore, while VI is effective for approximations, it is **not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies**. In situations where there are "almost ties" between actions, VI might require an "arbitrarily large amount of time" to close infinitesimally small value gaps, potentially running indefinitely. It is fundamentally an approximation algorithm for most practical purposes.

*   **Policy Iteration's Guarantee and Underlying Mechanism:**
    *   Policy Iteration (PI) is described as a "pretty amazing" algorithm because it guarantees to find an **exact optimal policy** in a **finite number of iterations** (specifically, \(O(S \cdot A / (1-\gamma))\) iterations, up to log factors), without the need for approximations or an \(\epsilon\) parameter.
    *   Its effectiveness stems from an **"elimination" process**. The algorithm works by systematically refining the policy such that, if the current policy is suboptimal, after a certain number of iterations (\(k^*\)), at least one "bad action" (an action chosen by a suboptimal policy in some state) will be "crossed out" and never chosen again by subsequent policies. This effectively prunes the search space of policies, leading to convergence to an optimal one. To ensure termination, PI systematically resolves ties in action selection (e.g., always choosing the action with the lowest index).

*   **The Context-Dependent Necessity of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) Factor:**
    *   The presence of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor in the complexity of algorithms like Policy Iteration, but its absence in the best-known lower bound of \(O(S \cdot A)\) for exact optimal policies, represents a "curious" and "delicate question".
    *   A significant insight is that the relevance of this factor depends on the **relationship between the number of states (S) and the "planning horizon" \(1/(1-\gamma)\)**. If the number of states (\(S\)) is small and fixed relative to \(1/(1-\gamma)\), it is theoretically possible to enumerate all \(A^S\) deterministic policies and compute their values to find the optimal one. In this specific scenario, the running time would be **independent of \(1/(1-\gamma)\)**. This demonstrates that the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) dependence is not universally inherent to planning and can be circumvented under specific conditions, particularly when the state space is not prohibitively large.

*   **Specificity of the Lower Bound and Problem Definition:**
    *   The discussed \(O(S \cdot A)\) lower bound is specifically for problems that require finding an **optimal action for *every* state** in the MDP. The illustrative example of finding the single "heaven" transition among \(S \cdot A\) possibilities necessitates checking each state-action pair.
    *   This implies a critical distinction: if the problem definition were relaxed—for example, if one only needed to find an optimal action for a *given starting state* rather than a complete optimal policy for all states—it might be possible to develop algorithms whose running time is **independent of the total number of states (\(S\))**. This highlights that the "S dependence" is "highly problematic" in current algorithms and changing the problem's scope could lead to computational savings.

*   **Absolute vs. Relative Error in Approximations:**
    *   When discussing approximate calculations, the \(\epsilon\) used (as in Value Iteration's `log(1/epsilon)` term) refers to an **absolute error bound** on the value function.
    *   However, if the goal is to keep **relative errors small** (i.e., the error is small compared to the magnitude of the optimal value), this task becomes "much harder" and is "almost like doing exact calculations". This distinction is crucial for practical applications, as an absolute error might be acceptable for large value differences but problematic for small ones.



We have discussed the broad categories of policies (memoryless and general), the rationale behind treating rewards in planning problems, and the fundamental algorithms of Value Iteration (VI) and Policy Iteration (PI), along with their computational complexities and lower bounds. Building upon our conversation and the provided sources, here are several additional nuanced insights:

*   **Value Iteration's Suitability for Approximation, Not Exactness**:
    *   While Value Iteration converges to the optimal value function (\(v^*\)) at an **exponentially fast, or geometric rate**, meaning its dependence on desired accuracy (\(\epsilon\)) is "very mild" (due to `log(1/epsilon)`), it is **not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies**.
    *   In scenarios with "almost ties" between actions, VI might require an "arbitrarily large amount of time" to close infinitesimally small value gaps, potentially running indefinitely. It is fundamentally an approximation algorithm for practical purposes.
    *   This raises the question of whether one needs **absolute error bounds** (like the \(\epsilon\) in VI) or **relative errors**. Maintaining small relative errors is "much harder" and "almost like doing exact calculations". However, if an absolute error is acceptable relative to the maximum possible reward, then approximate calculations are generally sufficient.

*   **Error Propagation in Value Iteration and Policy Optimality**:
    *   A critical practical nuance is that if you obtain a value function \(v_k\) that is \(\epsilon\)-close to \(v^*\) (i.e., \(\|v_k - v^*\|_{\max} \le \epsilon\)), the policy derived by greedifying \(v_k\) will only be **\(\epsilon / (1-\gamma)\) near-optimal**.
    *   This implies that the initial \(\epsilon\) for the value function approximation needs to be "pre-inflated" by a factor of \((1-\gamma)\) to achieve the desired policy optimality, as errors propagate and scale with the effective planning horizon. This leads to the total computational complexity of Value Iteration having a \(1/(1-\gamma)\) dependence, not just \(log(1/\epsilon)\).

*   **Policy Iteration's Guarantee and "Elimination" Mechanism**:
    *   Policy Iteration (PI) is considered "pretty amazing" because it guarantees to find an **exact optimal policy** in a **finite number of iterations**. Specifically, it completes within \(O(SA / (1-\gamma))\) iterations (up to log factors).
    *   Its underlying mechanism is an **"elimination" process**: If the current policy is suboptimal, after a certain number of iterations (\(k^*\), roughly proportional to \(SA/(1-\gamma)\)), at least one "bad action" (an action chosen by a suboptimal policy in some state) will be "crossed out" and never chosen again by subsequent policies. This effectively prunes the search space of policies, leading to convergence to an optimal one.
    *   To ensure termination and correctness, PI requires **systematically resolving ties** in action selection (e.g., always choosing the action with the lowest index).
    *   The policies considered in this "elimination" process are **deterministic policies**, as considering non-deterministic policies in this setting is "unnecessary".
    *   Calculating the value function for a given policy in PI can be done by **solving a linear equation** (matrix inversion of an \(S \times S\) matrix), which has a finite cost (e.g., \(S^3\) or \(S^{2.3}\) depending on the method).

*   **The Delicate Question of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) Factor in Computational Complexity**:
    *   The presence of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) factor in algorithms like Policy Iteration and the derived complexity for Value Iteration, but its absence in the best-known lower bound of \(O(SA)\) for exact optimal policies, presents a "curious" and "delicate question".
    *   A significant insight is that the relevance of this factor depends on the **relationship between the number of states (\(S\)) and the "planning horizon" \(1/(1-\gamma)\)**.
    *   If the number of states (\(S\)) is **small and fixed** relative to \(1/(1-\gamma)\), it is theoretically possible to **enumerate all \(A^S\) deterministic policies** and compute their values to find the optimal one. In this specific scenario, the running time would be **independent of \(1/(1-\gamma)\)**. This shows that the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) dependence is not universally inherent to all planning scenarios and can be circumvented under specific conditions.

*   **Specificity of the Lower Bound and Problem Definition**:
    *   The \(O(SA)\) lower bound discussed is specifically for problems that require finding an **optimal action for *every* state** in the MDP. The illustrative example involves finding a single "heaven" transition among \(SA\) possibilities, necessitating checking each state-action pair to ensure an optimal policy for all states.
    *   This highlights a crucial distinction: if the problem definition were relaxed—for example, if one only needed to find an optimal action for a *given starting state* rather than a complete optimal policy for all states—it might be possible to develop algorithms whose running time is **independent of the total number of states (\(S\))**. This means the "S dependence" is "highly problematic" in current algorithms, and changing the problem's scope could lead to computational savings.

*   **Operator Monotonicity as a Proof Technique**:
    *   A recurring technique in proving properties of value functions and operators (like the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) and the policy evaluation operator \(T_\pi\)) is their **monotonicity property**. If you apply a monotone operator to both sides of an inequality, the inequality is preserved. This, combined with fixed-point theorems (like the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, which guarantees unique fixed points and convergence for contractions in complete norm spaces), allows for chaining inequalities and proving convergence results for various algorithms.



The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs is a cornerstone result in reinforcement learning and optimal control, particularly for planning problems in finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It clarifies the relationship between optimal value functions and optimal policies, demonstrating that simpler memoryless policies are sufficient for optimality.

### Definition of an MDP
An MDP is formally defined as a **five-tuple** consisting of:
*   **States**
*   **Actions**
*   **Transitions**
*   **Rewards**
*   **Discounting**

### Policies in MDPs
Policies can be either **general** or **memoryless**.
*   **Memoryless policies** have a compact description and assign a probability distribution to every state. They are sufficient for optimal control in planning problems where the MDP is known.
*   **General policies** can potentially be more powerful by using the entire history of observations (including past rewards), especially when the MDP is unknown and learning is involved. However, for planning, the fundamental theorem shows that such generalization is "unnecessary" for finding optimal policies.

### The Fundamental Theorem
The theorem addresses whether policies need to use the history to achieve optimal performance in planning problems. It makes two key statements about the optimal value function, denoted as \(v^*\):

#### Part 1: Greedy Memoryless Policy is Optimal
*   **Statement:** If you have a memoryless policy \(\pi\) that is **greedy with respect to the optimal value function \(v^*\)**, then this policy \(\pi\) is an optimal policy. This means its value function, \(v_\pi\), will be equal to the optimal value function, \(v^*\).
*   **Definition of Greediness:** A policy \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(v^*\) if applying the policy's Bellman operator \(T_\pi\) to \(v^*\) yields the same result as applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to \(v^*\). In operator notation, this is expressed as: **\(T_\pi v^* = T v^*\)**. This implies that the policy \(\pi\) deterministically chooses actions that maximize the one-step Bellman look-ahead under \(v^*\).
*   **Operators Explained:**
    *   **\(T_\pi\) (Policy Evaluation Operator):** For a given policy \(\pi\) and value function \(v\), \(T_\pi v\) computes the immediate reward for taking actions according to \(\pi\) plus the discounted predicted future value if \(\pi\) is followed: \(R_\pi + \gamma P_\pi v\). This can also be seen as applying \(T_a\) (operator for a deterministic action \(a\)) based on the policy's chosen action.
    *   **\(T\) (Bellman Optimality Operator):** For a given value function \(v\), \(T v\) computes the maximum possible immediate reward plus the discounted predicted future value over all possible actions: \(T v = \max_a (R_a + \gamma P_a v)\). This involves a one-step optimal look-ahead.

#### Part 2: Optimal Value Function is a Fixed Point of the Bellman Optimality Operator
*   **Statement:** The optimal value function **\(v^*\) is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator \(T\)**.
*   **Definition of Fixed Point:** This means that applying the \(T\) operator to \(v^*\) results in \(v^*\) itself: **\(v^* = T v^*\)**.

### Proof Strategy and Key Insights
The proof of the fundamental theorem relies on two main parts:
1.  First, defining an "alternate optimal value function" \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) that only considers memoryless policies, proving the theorem for this \(v_{\tilde{*}}\).
2.  Then, showing that this \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) is indeed equal to the true optimal value function \(v^*\). The lecture focuses on proving the first part in detail.

Key elements and techniques used in the proof include:

*   **Monotonicity of Operators:** Both the policy evaluation operator (\(T_\pi\)) and the Bellman optimality operator (\(T\)) exhibit the **monotonicity property**. This means that if you apply these operators to both sides of an inequality (e.g., if \(v \le v'\)), the inequality is preserved (e.g., \(T_\pi v \le T_\pi v'\) and \(T v \le T v'\)). This property is fundamental because the operators involve adding rewards, multiplying by a stochastic matrix (which preserves inequality), and discounting, all of which maintain the inequality.
*   **Pulling Out Constants:** A useful property of these operators is that if you add a constant \(A\) (times the all-ones vector \(\mathbf{1}\)) to a value function \(v\) before applying the operator, the constant comes out multiplied by the discount factor \(\gamma\): \(T_\pi (v + A\mathbf{1}) = T_\pi v + \gamma A\mathbf{1}\) and \(T (v + A\mathbf{1}) = T v + \gamma A\mathbf{1}\). This linearity (for \(T_\pi\)) and quasi-linearity (for \(T\)) is crucial for error analysis in algorithms like Value Iteration.
*   **Banach Fixed Point Theorem and Convergence:** The proof extensively uses the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.
    *   The operators \(T_\pi\) and \(T\) are **contractions** in a complete norm space (such as the max-norm space of value functions on a Euclidean space). A contraction is a map that reduces the distance between any two points in the space.
    *   The theorem guarantees that any such contraction has a **unique fixed point**.
    *   Furthermore, repeated application of the operator on *any* initial function will **converge geometrically** to this unique fixed point. This principle is applied to show that repeated applications of \(T_\pi\) to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) converge to \(v_\pi\).
    *   The property that if a sequence of values maintains an inequality (e.g., \(a_k \ge b\)) and converges, its limit will also maintain that inequality (\(\lim a_k \ge b\)) is used to conclude convergence of the inequalities in the proof.

### Practical Implications
The fundamental theorem is pivotal because it establishes that:
*   Once the optimal value function (\(v^*\)) is known, finding an optimal policy is straightforward: **simply choose the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead under \(v^*\) for every state (greedify \(v^*\))**. This is a "non-expensive operation".
*   This theoretical guarantee underpins the validity of algorithms like **Value Iteration** which iteratively approximate \(v^*\). Although Value Iteration converges to \(v^*\) at an "exponentially fast, or geometric rate", it is primarily an approximation algorithm and "not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies" due to "almost ties" between actions.
*   The fact that **deterministic memoryless policies** are sufficient for optimality in MDPs simplifies the search space for optimal policies.



The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs is a crucial result that clarifies the relationship between optimal value functions and optimal policies in planning problems for finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It demonstrates that optimal performance can be achieved with simpler, memoryless policies.

An MDP is formally defined as a **five-tuple**: States, Actions, Transitions, Rewards, and Discounting. Policies in MDPs can be either **general** (potentially using the entire history of observations and rewards, especially when the MDP is unknown) or **memoryless** (assigning a probability distribution to every state). The theorem addresses whether policies need to use history to achieve optimal performance in planning problems, concluding it's "unnecessary" for optimal policies in this context.

The Fundamental Theorem states two key things about the optimal value function, denoted as \(v^*\):

1.  **If a memoryless policy \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(v^*\), then \(\pi\) is an optimal policy**, meaning its value function, \(v_\pi\), is equal to the optimal value function, \(v^*\).
2.  **The optimal value function \(v^*\) is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator \(T\)**, meaning \(v^* = T v^*\).

### Operators Defined

To understand the theorem and its proof, it's essential to define the relevant operators:
*   **\(T_\pi\) (Policy Evaluation Operator):** For a given policy \(\pi\) and value function \(v\), \(T_\pi v\) computes the immediate reward for actions taken according to \(\pi\) plus the discounted future value if \(\pi\) is followed. It is expressed as \(R_\pi + \gamma P_\pi v\).
*   **\(T_a\) (Deterministic Action Operator):** Similar to \(T_\pi\), but for a policy that takes a specific action \(a\) deterministically in every state.
*   **\(T\) (Bellman Optimality Operator):** For a given value function \(v\), \(T v\) computes the maximum possible immediate reward plus the discounted future value over all possible actions. It is expressed as \(T v = \max_a (R_a + \gamma P_a v)\), representing a one-step optimal look-ahead.
*   **Greediness:** A policy \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to a value function \(v\) if applying the policy's Bellman operator \(T_\pi\) to \(v\) yields the same result as applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to \(v\). In operator notation, this is **\(T_\pi v = T v\)**. This implies that \(\pi\) deterministically chooses actions that maximize the one-step Bellman look-ahead under \(v\).

### Proof of the Fundamental Theorem

The proof proceeds in two main parts:
1.  First, one defines an "alternate optimal value function" \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) that considers only memoryless policies. The theorem is then proven for this \(v_{\tilde{*}}\).
2.  Second, it is shown that this \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) is indeed equal to the true optimal value function \(v^*\). The lecture notes indicate that \(v^* = v_{\tilde{*}}\) was shown in a previous lecture, so the detailed proof within the provided source focuses on the first part.

Let's detail the proof:

#### Part 1: Proving that a Greedy Memoryless Policy is Optimal with Respect to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\)

We want to show that if \(\pi\) is a memoryless policy that is **greedy with respect to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\)** (i.e., \(T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} = T v_{\tilde{*}}\)), then **\(v_\pi = v_{\tilde{*}}\)**.

**Step A: Show \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\)**

1.  **Initial Inequality:** By definition, for any memoryless policy \(\pi\), its value function \(v_\pi\) must be less than or equal to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) (since \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) is the supremum over all memoryless policies): **\(v_\pi \le v_{\tilde{*}}\)**.
2.  **Monotonicity of Operators:** The operators \(T_\pi\) and \(T\) possess a **monotonicity property**: if \(v \le v'\), then \(T_\pi v \le T_\pi v'\) and \(T v \le T v'\). This holds because adding rewards, multiplying by stochastic matrices (which preserve inequalities), and discounting all maintain the inequality.
3.  **Apply \(T_\pi\) to the Inequality:** Apply \(T_\pi\) to both sides of \(v_\pi \le v_{\tilde{*}}\):
    \(T_\pi v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\).
4.  **Fixed Point Property of \(v_\pi\):** We know that \(v_\pi\) is the unique fixed point of its corresponding operator \(T_\pi\), meaning **\(v_\pi = T_\pi v_\pi\)**.
5.  **Combining to get \(v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\):** Substituting \(v_\pi\) for \(T_\pi v_\pi\) from the fixed point property, we get:
    **\(v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\)**.
6.  **Relating \(T_\pi\) to \(T\):** The Bellman optimality operator \(T\) maximizes over all actions, while \(T_\pi\) makes choices according to policy \(\pi\). Therefore, for any value function \(v\), \(T_\pi v \le T v\) pointwise.
7.  **Chaining Inequalities:** Combine the previous inequalities:
    \(v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\).
8.  **Taking the Supremum:** Since the inequality \(v_\pi \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\) holds for *any* memoryless policy \(\pi\), we can take the supremum over all memoryless policies on the left side:
    \(\sup_{\pi \in ML} v_\pi \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\).
    By definition, \(\sup_{\pi \in ML} v_\pi = v_{\tilde{*}}\).
    Thus, we conclude: **\(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\)**. This step is highlighted as a "very typical argument" used frequently in proofs.

**Step B: Show \(v_\pi \ge v_{\tilde{*}}\) (using greediness and Banach Fixed Point Theorem)**

1.  **Utilize Greediness:** Now, assume \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\). This means \(T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} = T v_{\tilde{*}}\).
2.  **Apply Greediness to Inequality from Step A:** Substitute \(T v_{\tilde{*}}\) with \(T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\) in the inequality \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\) from Step A:
    **\(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\)**.
3.  **Repeated Application of \(T_\pi\):** Since \(T_\pi\) is a monotonic operator, applying it repeatedly to both sides of this inequality preserves it:
    *   Apply \(T_\pi\) once: \(T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi (T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}) \implies T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi^2 v_{\tilde{*}}\).
    *   Since we also know \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\) (from the line above), we can substitute this into the right side of the expression: \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi^2 v_{\tilde{*}}\).
    *   By induction, repeating this \(k\) times: **\(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}\)** for any \(k \ge 1\).
4.  **Application of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem (Contraction Mapping Theorem):**
    *   The operator \(T_\pi\) is a **contraction** in a complete norm space (specifically, the max-norm space of value functions on a Euclidean space). A contraction is a map that strictly reduces the distance between any two points in the space.
    *   The Banach Fixed Point Theorem guarantees that any such contraction has a **unique fixed point**.
    *   Furthermore, repeated application of a contraction operator on *any* initial function in the space will **converge geometrically** to this unique fixed point.
    *   In this case, \(T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}\) converges to \(v_\pi\) as \(k \to \infty\) because \(v_\pi\) is the unique fixed point of \(T_\pi\).
5.  **Taking the Limit:** Take the limit as \(k \to \infty\) of the inequality \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}\):
    \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le \lim_{k \to \infty} (T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}})\).
    Since \(\lim_{k \to \infty} (T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}) = v_\pi\), we conclude: **\(v_{\tilde{*}} \le v_\pi\)**. The property that if a sequence of values maintains an inequality and converges, its limit will also maintain that inequality, is a basic property of real numbers and limits.

**Conclusion of Part 1:**
Having shown both \(v_\pi \le v_{\tilde{*}}\) (from Step A) and \(v_\pi \ge v_{\tilde{*}}\) (from Step B), it follows that **\(v_\pi = v_{\tilde{*}}\)**. This proves the first part of the theorem for \(v_{\tilde{*}}\).

#### Part 2: Proving that \(v^*\) is a Fixed Point of \(T\) (\(v^* = T v^*\))

This part also establishes that the optimal value function \(v^*\) is equal to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\).
1.  **Equivalence of \(v^*\) and \(v_{\tilde{*}}\):** The lecture notes state that **\(v^* = v_{\tilde{*}}\)** was shown previously. This means the optimal value achieved by considering *all* possible policies (general or memoryless) is the same as the optimal value achieved by only considering memoryless policies.
2.  **Using results from Part 1:** We already showed in Part 1 (Step A) that \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\). Since \(v^* = v_{\tilde{*}}\) this implies **\(v^* \le T v^*\)**.
3.  **Showing \(v^* \ge T v^*\):**
    *   Consider a policy \(\pi\) that is greedy with respect to \(v^*\). From Part 1 (and the equivalence \(v^* = v_{\tilde{*}}\)), we know that if such a greedy policy \(\pi\) exists, then **\(v_\pi = v^*\)**.
    *   We also know that \(v_\pi\) is the fixed point of \(T_\pi\), so **\(v_\pi = T_\pi v_\pi\)**.
    *   Substitute \(v_\pi = v^*\) into the fixed point equation: **\(v^* = T_\pi v^*\)**.
    *   Since \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(v^*\), by definition, **\(T_\pi v^* = T v^*\)**.
    *   Chaining these equalities, we get: **\(v^* = T v^*\)**.

**Conclusion of Part 2:**
Since both \(v^* \le T v^*\) and \(v^* \ge T v^*\) have been shown, it follows that **\(v^* = T v^*\)**. This proves that the optimal value function is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator.

### Practical Implications

The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs has significant practical consequences:
*   It demonstrates that **memoryless policies are sufficient for achieving optimality** in finite MDP planning problems. This simplifies the search for optimal policies because one doesn't need to consider policies that depend on the entire history of states and rewards.
*   It establishes that once the optimal value function \(v^*\) is known, **finding an optimal policy is a "non-expensive operation"**. One simply needs to perform a one-step look-ahead to choose the action that maximizes the expected future reward under \(v^*\) for each state. This process is called "greedifying \(v^*\)".
*   This theorem provides the theoretical foundation for algorithms like **Value Iteration**, which iteratively apply the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to an initial value function to converge to \(v^*\). Value Iteration converges "exponentially fast, or geometric rate" to \(v^*\). While Value Iteration is excellent for *approximating* \(v^*\), it's "not well-suited for finding *exact* optimal policies" due to potential "almost ties" between actions.
*   The theorem implies that if we obtain an approximate value function \(V\) that is \(\epsilon\)-close to \(v^*\) (i.e., \(\|V - v^*\|_\infty \le \epsilon\)), then greedifying \(V\) will yield a policy whose value is near-optimal, specifically within \(2\epsilon/(1-\gamma)\) of the optimal value. This means the error in the policy's value scales with \(\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\) times the error in the value function approximation.



The monotonicity property is a crucial characteristic of the operators used in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), specifically the policy evaluation operator (\(T_\pi\)) and the Bellman optimality operator (\(T\)).

Here's more detail about this property:

*   **Definition of Monotonicity:** An operator (or function) is considered **monotonic** if it preserves the order of its inputs. In the context of value functions in MDPs, this means that if one value function \(v\) is less than or equal to another value function \(v'\) (pointwise, meaning for every state), then applying a monotonic operator to both \(v\) and \(v'\) will result in \(T v \le T v'\) or \(T_\pi v \le T_\pi v'\).

*   **Why \(T_\pi\) and \(T\) are Monotonic:**
    *   The operators \(T_\pi\) and \(T\) involve three fundamental operations: adding rewards, multiplying by a stochastic matrix, and discounting.
    *   **Adding Rewards:** When you add a reward vector to a value function, if the original value function was smaller, the resulting sum will also be smaller.
    *   **Multiplying by a Stochastic Matrix:** Stochastic matrices, which represent state transitions, are known to preserve inequalities. This means if you have two value functions where one is pointwise less than or equal to the other, multiplying both by a stochastic transition matrix will maintain that inequality.
    *   **Discounting (\(\gamma\)):** Multiplying by the discount factor \(\gamma\) (which is between 0 and 1) also preserves inequalities.
    *   Since all these component operations preserve inequalities, the combined operators \(T_\pi\) and \(T\) are also **monotone**. Even though \(T\) involves a maximization step (making it a non-linear operator), it still maintains this monotonicity.

*   **Importance in Proofs:**
    *   The monotonicity property is **fundamental** for proving results in MDP theory, including the Fundamental Theorem. It allows for the chaining of inequalities, which is a common technique in these proofs.
    *   For example, in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem, to show that \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T v_{\tilde{*}}\) (where \(v_{\tilde{*}}\) is the optimal value function for memoryless policies), the proof starts with the definition \(v_\pi \le v_{\tilde{*}}\) for any memoryless policy \(\pi\). By applying the monotonic operator \(T_\pi\) to both sides, the inequality is preserved: \(T_\pi v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\). Since \(v_\pi = T_\pi v_\pi\) (because \(v_\pi\) is a fixed point of \(T_\pi\)), this leads to \(v_\pi \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\). This type of argument is described as a "very typical argument that people use in all kind of proofs".
    *   Similarly, it's used to show that if a policy \(\pi\) is greedy with respect to \(v_{\tilde{*}}\), then \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi v_{\tilde{*}}\). Repeated application of the monotonic operator \(T_\pi\) preserves this inequality, leading to \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}\) for any \(k \ge 1\). This is a crucial step before applying the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, which states that \(T_\pi^k v_{\tilde{*}}\) converges to \(v_\pi\) as \(k \to \infty\). Because the inequality is preserved, it eventually leads to \(v_{\tilde{*}} \le v_\pi\).

In essence, the monotonicity property ensures that if you start with an ordered relationship between value functions, that order is maintained when you apply the Bellman operators, which is vital for deriving the convergence and optimality properties of MDP algorithms and theorems.


The Bellman optimality operator, denoted as **T**, is a central concept in the discussion of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in the video. It plays a critical role in defining optimal value functions, proving fundamental theorems, and underpinning algorithms like Value Iteration.

Here's how the Bellman optimality operator is introduced and used:

### 1. Introduction and Definition
*   **Context:** The operator `T` is introduced in the context of the **Fundamental Theorem** of MDPs. This theorem clarifies whether general policies (which use history) can outperform memoryless policies in planning problems.
*   **Definition:** The `T` operator is defined as the "one step look ahead one step Bellman optimality look ahead" operator. It takes a value function (e.g., `v`) and returns a new value function by performing a maximization over all possible actions:
    *   **`T v`** = maximize over actions `a` of (`reward_for_action_a` + `gamma` * `sum_over_next_states (probability_of_s'_given_s_a * v(s'))`).
    *   This is represented compactly as **`T = max_a T_fa`**, where `T_fa` is a similar operator for a deterministic policy taking action `a`.

### 2. Key Properties
The Bellman optimality operator `T`, along with the policy evaluation operator `T_pi`, possesses crucial properties that are fundamental to MDP theory and proofs:

*   **Monotonicity:**
    *   **Definition:** An operator is monotonic if it preserves the order of its inputs. If `v <= v'` (pointwise, meaning for every state), then `T v <= T v'`.
    *   **Reasoning:** This property holds because the operations involved in `T` (adding rewards, multiplying by a stochastic matrix representing transitions, and discounting by `gamma`) all preserve inequalities. Even though `T` includes a maximization step (making it a non-linear operator), it still maintains monotonicity.
    *   **Importance:** Monotonicity is described as a "very typical argument that people use in all kind of proofs" in MDPs, allowing for the chaining of inequalities.
*   **Contraction:**
    *   The `T` operator is a **contraction mapping** in a complete normed vector space (like Euclidean spaces with the max norm).
    *   **Implication:** This property is essential because it means that repeated applications of `T` (i.e., `T^k v`) will converge to a **unique fixed point** at a geometric rate.

### 3. Usage in the Fundamental Theorem
The `T` operator is integral to the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem:

*   **Fixed Point of Optimal Value Function:** The second part of the theorem states that **`v*` (the optimal value function) is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator `T`**. This means `v* = T v*`.
*   **Greedy Policy:** The theorem also establishes that a memoryless policy `pi` that is **greedy with respect to `v*`** (meaning `T_pi v* = T v*`) is an optimal policy, and its value function `v_pi` will be equal to `v*`.

The proofs of these statements heavily rely on the monotonicity and contraction properties of `T` (and `T_pi`). For instance, to show that `v* <= T v*`, proofs use arguments that chain inequalities by applying the monotonic `T` operator.

### 4. Usage in Value Iteration
*   **Algorithm Core:** Value Iteration is an algorithm designed to compute an approximately optimal policy by approximating `v*`. The core of this algorithm is the **repeated application of the Bellman optimality operator `T`**:
    *   **`V_{k+1} = T V_k`**.
    *   The algorithm starts with an arbitrary initial value function (e.g., `V_0 = 0`) and iteratively applies `T`.
*   **Convergence:** Due to `T` being a contraction mapping, the sequence of value functions `V_k` generated by Value Iteration **converges to `v*` exponentially fast**.
*   **Error Bounds:** The analysis of Value Iteration's convergence rate and error bounds also utilizes a specific property of `T`: if you add a constant `a` (scaled by the all-ones vector `1`) to a value function `v`, `T` distributes this constant in a specific way: **`T(v + a * 1) = T(v) + gamma * a * 1`**. This property, despite `T` being non-linear, is crucial for tracking how errors propagate through iterations.
*   **Approximation:** Value iteration is good for approximate calculations, producing an `epsilon`-accurate estimate of `v*` within a logarithmic number of iterations (dependent on `1/epsilon`).

### 5. Usage in Policy Iteration
While Policy Iteration primarily involves evaluating policies (`V_pi_k`) and then finding a greedy policy with respect to that evaluation (`pi_{k+1}` being greedy with respect to `V_pi_k`), the act of "greedifying" (i.e., selecting the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead) implicitly involves the `T` operator's definition. The goal of policy iteration is to find an optimal policy without approximations, and it can terminate in a finite number of iterations.

In summary, the Bellman optimality operator `T` is not just a mathematical construct; it is the **computational engine for finding and verifying optimal solutions in MDPs**, serving as the foundation for both theoretical proofs and practical algorithms.



The Bellman optimal operator, denoted as **T**, can be applied multiple times, "up to k times," primarily because it possesses the crucial property of being a **contraction mapping**. This property, combined with the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem**, guarantees that repeated applications of the operator will lead to a unique and desirable outcome.

Here's a detailed explanation:

*   **The Nature of the Bellman Optimal Operator (T)**
    The `T` operator represents a "one step look ahead Bellman optimality look ahead". It takes a value function `v` and returns a new value function by performing a maximization over all possible actions for each state, considering immediate rewards and discounted future values.

*   **Contraction Mapping Property**
    *   The `T` operator (and similarly the policy evaluation operator `T_pi`) is a **contraction mapping** in a complete normed vector space, such as Euclidean spaces with the max norm.
    *   A contraction mapping is essentially an operator that brings points "closer together" with each application. More formally, it means that there's a Lipschitz constant (often the discount factor \(\gamma\)) that is **strictly smaller than 1**. This property dictates that the distance between the results of applying `T` to two different value functions will be smaller than the distance between the original value functions.

*   **Role of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem**
    *   The **Banach Fixed Point Theorem** is the fundamental mathematical tool that leverages the contraction property. It states that if you have a contraction mapping on a complete normed space, then:
        1.  There exists a **unique fixed point** for that operator. For the `T` operator, this unique fixed point is the **optimal value function, `v*`**.
        2.  Repeated application of the operator from *any* initial point will **converge to this unique fixed point**.

*   **"Applied So Many Times Up to K Times" in Practice**
    *   This repeated application is the core of the **Value Iteration algorithm**. Value Iteration starts with an arbitrary initial value function (often `V_0 = 0`) and then iteratively computes the next value function by applying the `T` operator: `V_{k+1} = T V_k`.
    *   Because `T` is a contraction, the sequence of value functions `V_k` generated by Value Iteration **converges to `v*` exponentially fast**.
    *   The "k times" refers to the number of iterations required to reach a desired level of accuracy. If you want an `epsilon`-accurate estimate of `v*`, the number of iterations `k` needed is proportional to `log(1/epsilon)`. This "log(1/epsilon) dependence" signifies a "geometric rate" or "really fast rate," meaning the algorithm is not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy.

*   **Monotonicity (Complementary Property)**
    *   While the contraction property ensures convergence, the **monotonicity property** of `T` (and `T_pi`) ensures that inequalities are preserved during these repeated applications. If `v <= v'` (pointwise), then `T v <= T v'`.
    *   This is crucial for proofs, allowing for the chaining of inequalities, which is a "very typical argument that people use in all kind of proofs" in MDP theory. For example, in showing that a greedy policy's value function (`v_pi`) is at least as large as `v_tilde_star` (an alternative optimal value function), the proof repeatedly applies the monotonic `T_pi` operator to preserve and propagate an inequality until convergence to `v_pi` is used.

In essence, the `T` operator's ability to be applied multiple times and converge to a meaningful solution (`v*`) is a direct consequence of its inherent mathematical structure as a contraction mapping, as formalized by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.



The first part of the proof of the **Fundamental Theorem of MDPs** addresses the relationship between an optimal value function and a greedy policy.

The theorem states two main things:
1.  **Part 1**: If you have a memoryless policy `pi` that is **greedy with respect to `v*`** (the optimal value function), then this policy `pi` is an **optimal policy**, meaning its value function `v_pi` will be equal to `v*`.
2.  **Part 2**: The optimal value function `v*` is a **fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator `T`**, meaning `v* = T v*`.

The video focuses on detailing the proof for **Part 1**, assuming that `v*` is equal to `v_tilde_star`, where `v_tilde_star` is defined as the optimal value function for *memoryless* policies. The equivalence `v* = v_tilde_star` was proven in a previous session (Part 2 of the overarching proof, but often handled first because it simplifies the discussion of Part 1).

Thus, the goal of proving Part 1 becomes: **Show that if `pi` is greedy with respect to `v_tilde_star`, then `v_pi` is equal to `v_tilde_star`**.

Here's how the proof unfolds, relying heavily on the properties of the Bellman operators:

*   **Initial Bounds**:
    *   By the definition of `v_tilde_star` (as the supremum over all memoryless policies' value functions), it is automatically true that for any memoryless policy `pi`, **`v_pi <= v_tilde_star`**.
    *   Therefore, to prove `v_pi = v_tilde_star`, the main task is to show that `v_pi >= v_tilde_star`.

*   **Establishing `v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`**:
    *   Take any arbitrary memoryless policy `pi`.
    *   We know that `v_pi` is a fixed point of its policy evaluation operator `T_pi`, meaning **`v_pi = T_pi v_pi`**.
    *   Since `v_pi <= v_tilde_star`, and the operator `T_pi` possesses the **monotonicity property** (i.e., it preserves inequalities), we can apply `T_pi` to both sides: `T_pi v_pi <= T_pi v_tilde_star`.
    *   Furthermore, the Bellman optimality operator `T` is defined as maximizing over all actions (i.e., `T = max_a T_fa`, where `T_fa` is like `T_pi` for a deterministic policy taking action `a`). This means that `T` will always yield a value at least as great as `T_pi` for any policy `pi`, so **`T_pi v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`**.
    *   Chaining these inequalities: `v_pi = T_pi v_pi <= T_pi v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`.
    *   Since this holds for *any* memoryless policy `pi`, taking the supremum over all such `pi` on the left side gives `v_tilde_star`.
    *   Thus, we conclude that **`v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`**. This step is highlighted as a "very typical argument that people use in all kind of proofs" in MDP theory.

*   **Proving `v_pi >= v_tilde_star` for a Greedy Policy**:
    *   Now, consider a policy `pi` that is specifically **greedy with respect to `v_tilde_star`**.
    *   By the definition of greediness, this means that applying `T_pi` to `v_tilde_star` yields the same result as applying `T` to `v_tilde_star`: **`T_pi v_tilde_star = T v_tilde_star`**.
    *   From the previous step, we know `T v_tilde_star >= v_tilde_star`.
    *   Combining these, we get **`T_pi v_tilde_star >= v_tilde_star`**.
    *   The crucial next step is to **apply the operator `T_pi` repeatedly (`k` times)** to both sides of this inequality:
        *   Since `T_pi` is monotonic, applying it once more gives `T_pi (T_pi v_tilde_star) >= T_pi v_tilde_star`, which is `T_pi^2 v_tilde_star >= T_pi v_tilde_star`.
        *   As `T_pi v_tilde_star` is itself greater than or equal to `v_tilde_star`, this implies `T_pi^2 v_tilde_star >= v_tilde_star`.
        *   This pattern continues, leading to `T_pi^k v_tilde_star >= v_tilde_star` for any `k`.
    *   The operator `T_pi` is a **contraction mapping** in the max norm space (which is complete).
    *   Therefore, by the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem**, repeated applications of `T_pi` to *any* function (including `v_tilde_star`) will **converge to `v_pi`** (which is the unique fixed point of `T_pi`) as `k` approaches infinity.
    *   Taking the limit as `k` goes to infinity, the inequality `T_pi^k v_tilde_star >= v_tilde_star` is preserved.
    *   This directly leads to the conclusion that **`v_pi >= v_tilde_star`**.

*   **Final Conclusion of Part 1**:
    *   Having shown both `v_pi <= v_tilde_star` and `v_pi >= v_tilde_star`, it is definitively proven that **`v_pi = v_tilde_star`**.
    *   Since `v_tilde_star` was previously shown to be equal to `v*` (the true optimal value function), this means that a policy `pi` that is greedy with respect to `v*` is indeed an optimal policy.



The second part of the **Fundamental Theorem of MDPs** states that the **optimal value function, `v*`, is a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator `T`**. This means that applying the `T` operator to `v*` yields `v*` itself, i.e., **`v* = T v*`**.

The proof of this part leverages the conclusion of the first part of the theorem and the properties of the Bellman operators.

Here's how the proof unfolds:

1.  **Relating `v*` to `v_tilde_star`**: The lecture establishes that `v*` (the optimal value function over all general policies) is equivalent to `v_tilde_star` (the optimal value function over memoryless policies). Therefore, proving `v* = T v*` is equivalent to proving `v_tilde_star = T v_tilde_star`.

2.  **Establishing One Inequality (`v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`)**:
    *   As shown in the first part of the proof, for any memoryless policy `pi`, its value function `v_pi` is less than or equal to `v_tilde_star` by definition (`v_pi <= v_tilde_star`).
    *   By applying the policy evaluation operator `T_pi` (which is monotonic) and then the Bellman optimality operator `T` (which maximizes over actions, so `T_pi v <= T v`), it was demonstrated that `v_pi <= T v_tilde_star`.
    *   Since this holds for *any* memoryless policy `pi`, taking the supremum over all such `pi` on the left side (which by definition is `v_tilde_star`) leads to the conclusion that **`v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star`**.

3.  **Establishing the Other Inequality (`v* >= T v*`)**:
    *   Consider a memoryless policy `pi` that is **greedy with respect to `v*`** (or `v_tilde_star`).
    *   From the **first part of the Fundamental Theorem**, we know that if `pi` is greedy with respect to `v*`, then `pi` is an optimal policy, meaning its value function `v_pi` is equal to `v*` (`v_pi = v*`).
    *   By the definition of the policy evaluation operator, `v_pi` is a **fixed point of `T_pi`**, meaning `v_pi = T_pi v_pi`.
    *   Substitute `v_pi = v*` into the fixed-point equation: `v* = T_pi v*`.
    *   Now, recall the definition of a greedy policy with respect to `v*`: it means that applying `T_pi` to `v*` yields the same result as applying `T` to `v*` (`T_pi v* = T v*`).
    *   By chaining these equalities, we get: **`v* = T_pi v* = T v*`**. This directly shows that `v*` is greater than or equal to `T v*` (and in fact, equal to it).

4.  **Conclusion**:
    *   Since both `v_tilde_star <= T v_tilde_star` and `v* = T v*` have been proven, and knowing `v* = v_tilde_star`, it is definitively concluded that **`v* = T v*`**. This confirms that the optimal value function is indeed a fixed point of the Bellman optimality operator.



The **Banach Fixed Point Theorem** is a crucial mathematical tool in the theory of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly for understanding the convergence of algorithms like Value Iteration and for proving fundamental properties of optimal value functions. It provides a guarantee for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point for certain types of operators, along with a method for finding that fixed point through iteration.

Here are the details of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem as discussed in the sources and our conversation:

*   **Conditions for Application**:
    *   **Complete Normed Vector Space**: The theorem requires a **vector space on which a norm is defined, and which is complete**.
        *   A complete vector space is one where every Cauchy sequence (a sequence whose elements get arbitrarily close to each other) converges to a limit that is also within the space.
        *   Euclidean spaces, which are commonly used for value functions in MDPs, are examples of complete normed vector spaces. All norms in a Euclidean space are equivalent, and the **max norm** (the largest absolute difference between corresponding components of two vectors) is particularly relevant for MDPs, as the space with this norm is complete.
    *   **Operator Mapping to Itself**: There must be an **operator (or map) that takes an element from this space and maps it back into the same space**.
    *   **Contraction Mapping**: The operator must be a **contraction mapping**.
        *   A contraction mapping is an operator that brings points "closer together" with each application, meaning the distance between the results of applying the operator to two different points will be smaller than the distance between the original points [my previous response].
        *   Formally, it means there exists a **Lipschitz constant that is strictly smaller than 1**. In the context of Bellman operators (`T` and `T_pi`) in MDPs, the **discount factor (\(\gamma\))** serves as this Lipschitz constant, and it is always strictly less than 1 [my previous response].

*   **Conclusions of the Theorem**:
    *   **Unique Fixed Point**: If the aforementioned conditions are satisfied, then there **exists a unique fixed point for that operator**.
        *   In MDPs, for the **Bellman optimality operator (`T`)**, its unique fixed point is the **optimal value function (`v*`)** [my previous response].
        *   For the **policy evaluation operator (`T_pi`)**, its unique fixed point is the **value function of policy `pi` (`v_pi`)** [7, my previous response].
    *   **Convergence Through Iteration**: **Repeated application of the operator from *any* initial point will converge to this unique fixed point** [7, 8, my previous response].
        *   This convergence happens at a **geometric rate**, also described as an exponential or "really fast" rate. This means the algorithm is not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy.
        *   This principle is the cornerstone of the **Value Iteration algorithm**. Value Iteration iteratively computes `V_{k+1} = T V_k` starting from an arbitrary `V_0` (often `V_0 = 0`), and the Banach Fixed Point Theorem guarantees that this sequence `V_k` will converge to `v*` exponentially fast [10, my previous response].
        *   The theorem is also leveraged in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of MDPs. For instance, in proving that a greedy policy is optimal, the argument relies on repeatedly applying the `T_pi` operator to a function (e.g., `v_tilde_star`) and knowing that this sequence converges to `v_pi` by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem [7, my previous response].

In summary, the ability to apply the Bellman optimal operator and policy evaluation operators multiple times and guarantee convergence to the optimal or policy-specific value function is a direct consequence of their mathematical structure as contraction mappings, as formalized by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem [my previous response].



Value Iteration is a fundamental algorithm in Reinforcement Learning, primarily used to compute an **approximately optimal value function** for a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). From this approximate value function, a **near-optimal policy** can then be derived.

Here are the full details of Value Iteration:

### 1. Purpose and Basic Idea
The **Fundamental Theorem of MDPs** states that if you know the true optimal value function (`v*`), you can directly obtain an optimal policy by simply performing a one-step look-ahead maximization (a process known as "greedifying"). However, `v*` is generally unknown. Value Iteration provides a **simple idea to get a function that is close to `v*`**.

### 2. The Algorithm
Value Iteration is an iterative process that repeatedly applies the Bellman optimality operator (`T`) to an estimated value function.
*   **Initialization**: You start with an **arbitrary initial value function, `V_0`**. A common and practical choice is to initialize **`V_0` to an all-zeros vector**. It's generally safe to initialize `V_0` within the range of possible value functions, such as `[0, 1/(1-gamma)]` if rewards are normalized.
*   **Iteration Rule**: In each step `k`, the next iterate `V_{k+1}` is computed by applying the Bellman optimality operator `T` to the current iterate `V_k`:
    $$V_{k+1} = T V_k$$
    This involves, for each state `s`:
    $$V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) V_k(s') \right)$$
    where `R(s,a)` is the immediate reward for taking action `a` in state `s`, `P(s'|s,a)` is the probability of transitioning to state `s'` from state `s` with action `a`, and `gamma` is the discount factor.

### 3. Theoretical Foundation: The Banach Fixed Point Theorem
The power and guarantees of Value Iteration come directly from the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem**.
*   **Complete Normed Space**: Value functions exist in a complete normed vector space (e.g., Euclidean space with the max norm).
*   **Contraction Mapping**: The Bellman optimality operator (`T`) is a **contraction mapping** on this space. This means that applying `T` to two different value functions brings their "distance" (in terms of the max norm) closer together. The **discount factor `gamma` serves as the Lipschitz constant** for this contraction, and it must be strictly less than 1 for the theorem to apply.
*   **Guaranteed Convergence**: The theorem **implies that `V_k` converges to `v*` (the unique fixed point of `T`) exponentially fast** as `k` approaches infinity. This means that even from an arbitrary starting point, the iterative application of `T` is guaranteed to eventually find the optimal value function.

### 4. Computational Aspects
*   **Cost per Iteration**: Each iteration of Value Iteration involves calculations for every state. For a given state, you must consider all possible actions, and for each action, sum over all possible next states. This results in a computational cost per iteration that is proportional to `S * A * S`, or more precisely, `S * A * S'` where `S` is the number of states, `A` is the number of actions, and `S'` is the number of possible next states (which can be `S` in the worst case). The source mentions this as `S*A` (assuming `S` is implicitly included in the averaging/summing over next states for each action choice per state).
*   **Convergence Rate and Epsilon-Accuracy**: The convergence is at a **geometric or exponential rate**, also described as "really fast". This means the algorithm is not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy.
    *   The error at iteration `k` (the maximum difference between `V_k` and `v*` in max norm) can be bounded by:
        $$||V_k - v^*||_{\max} \leq \gamma^k \frac{||v^*||_{\max}}{1 - \gamma}$$
        Since value functions (with rewards between 0 and 1) are bounded by `1/(1-gamma)`, the bound simplifies to:
        $$||V_k - v^*||_{\max} \leq \frac{\gamma^k}{1 - \gamma}$$
    *   To achieve an **epsilon-accurate estimate of `v*`** (i.e., `||V_k - v*||_max <= epsilon`), the number of iterations `k` required is given by the **epsilon horizon**:
        $$k \geq \frac{\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon(1-\gamma)})}{\log(\frac{1}{\gamma})}$$
        This shows a **mild `log(1/epsilon)` dependence**, which is very favorable.
*   **Total Computational Complexity**: The total computational complexity is the cost per iteration multiplied by the number of iterations. This often results in a dependence on `S^2 * A` (from the per-iteration cost) multiplied by the epsilon horizon, leading to something like `S^2 * A * log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`.

### 5. Obtaining a Near-Optimal Policy
The ultimate goal is to find a good policy, not just `v*`.
*   **Greedification**: Once Value Iteration computes `V_k` (an approximation of `v*`), you can **"greedify" `V_k` to obtain a policy `pi_k`**. This means, for each state `s`, `pi_k(s)` chooses the action `a` that maximizes the one-step look-ahead value using `V_k` as the estimate for future values:
    $$\pi_k(s) = \arg\max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) V_k(s') \right)$$
*   **Policy Suboptimality**: If `V_k` is `epsilon`-close to `v*` (i.e., `||V_k - v*||_max <= epsilon`), the policy `pi_k` obtained by greedifying `V_k` will be **near-optimal up to a factor of `epsilon / (1-gamma)`**. Formally, this means the value function of the greedy policy, `v_{pi_k}`, will satisfy:
    $$v_{\pi_k} \geq v^* - \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \gamma} \mathbf{1}$$
    where `1` is the all-ones vector. This implies that to get a policy that is `epsilon`-optimal, you need to run Value Iteration until `V_k` is `epsilon * (1-gamma)`-close to `v*`. The proof of this suboptimality bound involves properties of Bellman operators, monotonicity, and the fixed-point property (as discussed in the first part of the Fundamental Theorem's proof).

### 6. Limitations and Considerations
*   **Approximate vs. Exact Calculation**: Value Iteration is **not good for exact calculations**. It can run indefinitely if there are very small differences between action values, making it hard to determine when to stop for an "exact" optimal policy.
*   **Suitability for Approximation**: However, for **approximate calculations, it's very effective** due to its favorable `log(1/epsilon)` dependence on accuracy.
*   **Comparison to Policy Iteration**: Value Iteration is often compared to Policy Iteration. Policy Iteration can terminate in a finite number of steps and find an *exact* optimal policy, while Value Iteration is inherently an approximation method. Policy Iteration is often "at least as fast in terms of its iteration complexity as Value Iteration".



In the context of Value Iteration and optimization algorithms, understanding the difference between "geometric rate" and "linear rate" of convergence is important, although these terms can sometimes be used in a way that might seem contradictory to those outside specific fields.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Geometric Rate of Convergence (or Exponential/Really Fast Rate)**:
    *   This is the **favorable type of convergence** observed in Value Iteration.
    *   It means that the **error (the distance between the current estimate and the true optimal value function) shrinks by a constant factor with each iteration** [my previous response].
    *   For Value Iteration, this constant factor is the **discount factor (\(\gamma\))**. Specifically, the error at iteration `k` is bounded by \(\gamma^k\) multiplied by a constant related to the optimal value function and discount factor: \(||V_k - v^*||_{\max} \leq \gamma^k \frac{||v^*||_{\max}}{1 - \gamma}\) [my previous response, 11]. Since \(\gamma < 1\), the term \(\gamma^k\) decreases very rapidly as `k` increases.
    *   A key characteristic of geometric convergence is that the **number of iterations (`k`) required to achieve an epsilon-accurate estimate depends logarithmically on `1/epsilon`** [my previous response, 11]. This relationship is expressed by the "epsilon horizon" formula: \(k \geq \frac{\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon(1-\gamma)})}{\log(\frac{1}{\gamma})}\) [my previous response, 11].
    *   The `log(1/epsilon)` dependence is considered **"very mild"** and indicates a **"really fast rate"** of convergence, meaning the algorithm is "not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy" [my previous response, 11].

*   **"Linear Rate" in Optimization Context**:
    *   While colloquially "linear" might suggest a constant *additive* decrease in error (e.g., error decreases by `c` in each step), in optimization literature, the term "linear convergence" can sometimes refer to **what is mathematically a geometric rate**.
    *   The source explains that "optimization people are a little bit more pessimistic and then just call this linear". This implies that what some fields call "geometric" (error reducing by a *factor*) is termed "linear" by others (perhaps because when plotted on a log scale, the error reduction looks linear, or because `log(1/epsilon)` is linear in `k`).
    *   Regardless of the terminology, the underlying mathematical behavior for Value Iteration remains the same: **the error decreases exponentially fast**, which is highly efficient for achieving approximate solutions.

In summary, when discussing Value Iteration, "geometric rate" highlights the **exponentially decreasing error per iteration**, leading to a desirable **logarithmic dependence on the desired accuracy** [my previous response, 11]. The use of "linear rate" in some optimization circles is a different naming convention for this same rapid convergence characteristic.


To compute a (near-)optimal policy by **greedification**, you first need an estimate of the optimal value function, typically denoted as `v*` or `V_k` if it's an approximation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

*   **The Core Idea: One-Step Look-Ahead Maximization**
    Greedification means that for each state `s` in your Markov Decision Process (MDP), you choose the action `a` that maximizes the immediate reward plus the discounted expected future value, where the future value is estimated using your current value function. This is essentially a **one-step Bellman optimality look-ahead**.

*   **When `v*` is Known (The Ideal Case)**
    The **Fundamental Theorem of MDPs** states that if you know the true optimal value function `v*`, you can directly obtain an optimal policy. This is achieved by greedifying `v*`. The policy `pi(s)` for each state `s` would be:
    $$\pi(s) = \arg\max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) v^*(s') \right)$$
    where `R(s,a)` is the immediate reward for taking action `a` in state `s`, `P(s'|s,a)` is the transition probability to state `s'` from `s` with action `a`, and `gamma` is the discount factor. The policy obtained this way is a **memoryless policy**. This operation of "reading out" an optimal policy from `v*` is considered **non-expensive**.

*   **When `v*` is Approximated (Using Value Iteration)**
    In practice, `v*` is usually unknown, so Value Iteration is used to compute an **approximately optimal value function `V_k`**. Value Iteration is a simple iterative idea to get a function close to `v*` [Our conversation history].
    1.  **Run Value Iteration**: Start with an arbitrary initial value function (e.g., all zeros). In each iteration `k`, update the value function for every state `s` using the Bellman optimality operator:
        $$V_{k+1}(s) = \max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) V_k(s') \right)$$
        This process converges to `v*` **exponentially fast** (also known as geometric rate) due to the Banach Fixed Point Theorem. The dependence on the desired accuracy (`epsilon`) is **very mild (log(1/epsilon))**, making it efficient for approximate calculations [11, Our conversation history].
    2.  **Greedify `V_k`**: Once `V_k` is computed (after `k` iterations), you **greedify `V_k` to obtain a policy `pi_k`**. For each state `s`, `pi_k(s)` is chosen as:
        $$\pi_k(s) = \arg\max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) V_k(s') \right)$$
       .

*   **Policy Optimality Guarantee**
    If `V_k` is `epsilon`-close to `v*` in max norm (i.e., \(||V_k - v^*||_{\max} \leq \epsilon\)), then the policy `pi_k` obtained by greedifying `V_k` will be **near-optimal**. Specifically, its value function `v_{pi_k}` will be close to `v*` up to a factor of \(\frac{\epsilon}{1 - \gamma}\). This means \(v_{\pi_k} \geq v^* - \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \gamma} \mathbf{1}\). This is a crucial result, implying that greedifying a good approximation of the optimal value function yields a good approximation of the optimal policy.

*   **Computational Cost for Greedification**
    The actual greedification step itself (finding the argmax for each state) is a **finite computation**. For each state, it involves checking all actions and their expected next-state values, making its cost proportional to `S * A` (number of states times number of actions) if transitions are dense, or `S * A * S'` if `S'` is the number of possible next states. The overall computational complexity of Value Iteration to get a near-optimal policy is dominated by the iterations, scaling with `S^2 * A * log(1/epsilon) / (1-gamma)`.

In summary, greedification is the mechanism that translates knowledge of (or an approximation of) the optimal value function into a concrete optimal (or near-optimal) action choice for every state.


The **stochastic matrix**, often denoted as `P` or `P_pi` (when associated with a specific policy \(\pi\)), is a fundamental component in the mathematical framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly when calculating value functions.

Here's what the sources and our conversation history tell us about it:

*   **Representation of Transition Probabilities**: The stochastic matrix represents the **transition probabilities** of an MDP under a specific policy. When you have a policy \(\pi\), for each state `s`, it specifies an action `a`. The transitions from `s` to next states `s'` are then governed by `P(s'|s,a)`. If we fix a policy \(\pi\), we can form a matrix `P_pi` where each row `s` gives the probabilities of transitioning to `s'` when action `pi(s)` is taken [implied by 13, 17].

*   **Key Properties**:
    *   **Monotonicity**: Stochastic matrices have a **monotonicity property**. This means that if you have two value functions, say \(V_1\) and \(V_2\), such that \(V_1 \le V_2\) (point-wise), then applying the stochastic matrix (multiplied by the discount factor) will preserve this inequality. As the source states, "stochastic matrices keep this inequality". This property is crucial for proving the convergence of Value Iteration and for deriving various inequalities in MDP theory.
    *   **Rows Sum to One**: A defining characteristic of a stochastic matrix is that **all of its rows sum to one**. This reflects the fact that from any given state, the probabilities of transitioning to all possible next states must sum to 1 (because the agent must transition to *some* state). This property has important implications for how constants behave when passed through the Bellman operator. For example, if you apply `P_pi` to a vector of all ones, the result is also a vector of all ones (i.e., `P_pi * 1 = 1`).

*   **Role in Bellman Operators and Value Functions**:
    *   **Future Value Calculation**: The stochastic matrix is integral to calculating the **discounted expected future value** in both the Bellman operator for a specific policy (\(T_\pi\)) and the Bellman optimality operator (\(T\)). It's used in the term `gamma * sum_s' P(s'|s,a) V(s')` or compactly `gamma * P_pi * V`.
    *   **Linear System for Policy Evaluation**: For any given **memoryless policy** \(\pi\), its value function \(v_\pi\) is the unique fixed point of the Bellman operator \(T_\pi\). This can be expressed as a linear system: \(v_\pi = R_\pi + \gamma P_\pi v_\pi\), where \(R_\pi\) is the immediate reward vector under policy \(\pi\). This equation can be rearranged to solve for \(v_\pi\) directly by inverting a matrix: \(v_\pi = (I - \gamma P_\pi)^{-1} R_\pi\). This matrix inversion is computationally intensive, scaling with \(S^3\) (number of states cubed), but it provides an exact value function for the policy.

*   **Significance in Proofs**: The properties of stochastic matrices (monotonicity and row sums) are repeatedly used in proofs for MDP algorithms, such as those demonstrating the convergence of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, and in showing that greedifying a near-optimal value function yields a near-optimal policy. The ability to "pull out" constants when the Bellman operator acts on a function shifted by a constant, like \(T(V + a\mathbf{1}) = T(V) + \gamma a\mathbf{1}\), directly relies on the stochastic matrix property that `P_pi * 1 = 1`.



Yinyu Ye's work, along with his collaborators, represents a significant breakthrough in the understanding of the computational complexity of Policy Iteration for finding exact optimal policies in finite MDPs.

Here are the key details and implications of this breakthrough:

*   **The Problem Addressed**: Before this work, it was known that Policy Iteration is "always at least as fast in terms of its iteration complexity as value iteration". However, a precise bound on the number of iterations for finding an *exact* optimal policy without approximations was not known until relatively recently.
*   **The Breakthrough Result**: Yinyu Ye and his colleagues (specifically, a paper by Yinyu Ye, Ichiro Inan, and Mengdi Wang in 2017 is mentioned, though it's described as "unpublished paper in 2017") figured out a way to show that Policy Iteration needs **poly \(S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma)\) iterations**.
    *   **Poly \(S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma)\)**: This means the number of iterations is polynomial in the number of states (\(S\)), actions (\(A\)), and the "planning horizon" term \(1/(1 - \gamma)\).
    *   **No Epsilon Dependence**: Crucially, this bound states that the algorithm can "stop and output an optimal policy" after this many iterations, implying **no dependence on \(\epsilon\) (the desired accuracy)**. This is considered "pretty amazing" because it suggests that the \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence, which is characteristic of Value Iteration for *approximate* calculations, might not be necessary for *exact* optimal policies.
*   **Contrast with Value Iteration**:
    *   **Value Iteration (Approximate)**: Value Iteration converges to an \(\epsilon\)-accurate estimate of the optimal value function with an iteration complexity of roughly \(\log(1/\epsilon) / \log(1/\gamma)\). This \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence is considered "very mild" and a "geometric rate," meaning it's "not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy" for *approximate* solutions.
    *   **Policy Iteration (Exact)**: Yinyu Ye's result shows that for *exact* optimal policies, Policy Iteration avoids the \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) term entirely, providing a bound that does not require approximation.
    *   **Computational Cost per Iteration**: While Policy Iteration can provide an exact optimal policy, its computational cost *per iteration* is generally higher than Value Iteration. Policy Iteration requires calculating the exact value function for a policy, which typically involves **solving a linear system by inverting a matrix**, costing around \(S^3\) (or \(S^{2.3...}\)) computations. Value Iteration, on the other hand, involves finite and often simpler computations per state for each iteration, summing up to around \(S \cdot A \cdot S'\) or \(S \cdot A\).
*   **Mechanism of Policy Iteration and the Bound**:
    *   Policy Iteration works by iteratively improving a policy: you evaluate the current policy (\(v_{\pi_k}\)), then greedify that value function to get a new, improved policy (\(\pi_{k+1}\)).
    *   The proof behind Yinyu Ye's bound relies on an "elimination" argument. It shows that if you start with a sub-optimal policy, after roughly \(k^*\) iterations (where \(k^*\) is \(\approx \log(\text{factors } S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma))\)), there will be at least one state for which the action chosen by the initial policy will *never* be chosen again by subsequent iterates. Since there are a finite number of state-action pairs, and "bad" actions are progressively eliminated, this process must terminate after a finite number of such \(k^*\) blocks, leading to the overall bound.
*   **Significance of \(1/(1-\gamma)\) Term**: This "planning horizon" term appears in many bounds for MDPs, including for Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. The question of whether this \(1/(1-\gamma)\) dependence is truly necessary (i.e., whether tighter bounds exist without it) is a "dedicated question" in the field.
*   **Practical vs. Theoretical Implications**: While this breakthrough provides a strong theoretical guarantee for exact calculations, the speaker notes that in practice, "very rarely need exact calculation," and "approximate calculations are fine" due to the mild \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence of Value Iteration. However, the result for Policy Iteration is still "pretty amazing".



**Matrix inversion** is a key computational step within the **Policy Iteration algorithm** when it aims to find an *exact* optimal policy for a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Here's a detailed explanation:

*   **Role in Policy Evaluation**: In Policy Iteration, each step involves two main phases:
    1.  **Policy Evaluation**: Given a current policy \(\pi_k\), you need to compute its value function, \(v_{\pi_k}\).
    2.  **Policy Improvement**: Once \(v_{\pi_k}\) is known, you greedily update the policy to \(\pi_{k+1}\).
    Matrix inversion comes into play during the Policy Evaluation phase. The value function \(v_\pi\) for any given memoryless policy \(\pi\) is the unique fixed point of its associated Bellman operator \(T_\pi\) [My previous response]. This can be written as a **linear system of equations**:
    \(v_\pi = R_\pi + \gamma P_\pi v_\pi\) [My previous response].
    Where:
    *   \(v_\pi\) is the vector of values for each state under policy \(\pi\).
    *   \(R_\pi\) is the vector of immediate rewards when following policy \(\pi\).
    *   \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
    *   \(P_\pi\) is the stochastic matrix representing the transition probabilities when following policy \(\pi\) [My previous response].
    This linear system can be rearranged to directly solve for \(v_\pi\):
    \(v_\pi = (I - \gamma P_\pi)^{-1} R_\pi\).
    The term \((I - \gamma P_\pi)^{-1}\) signifies the need for **matrix inversion**.

*   **Computational Cost**:
    *   Performing this matrix inversion for an \(S \times S\) matrix (where \(S\) is the number of states) is computationally intensive. Its cost typically scales with **\(S^3\)** (number of states cubed). Faster algorithms might reduce this to \(S^{2.3...}\), but it remains a cubic or near-cubic operation with respect to the number of states.
    *   This makes the *per-iteration cost* of Policy Iteration generally much higher than that of Value Iteration, which involves simpler finite computations for each state in an iteration, roughly scaling with \(S \cdot A \cdot S'\) (states * actions * number of next states).

*   **Alternative to Matrix Inversion**:
    *   Instead of directly inverting the matrix, you could **iteratively apply the \(T_\pi\) operator** (i.e., \(V_{k+1} = R_\pi + \gamma P_\pi V_k\)) to find \(v_\pi\) approximately. This would be an *approximate* way of solving the linear equation and might be faster if an exact solution for \(v_\pi\) is not required.

*   **Significance in Policy Iteration Breakthrough**:
    *   Despite the high per-iteration cost of matrix inversion, Yinyu Ye's breakthrough (with Ichiro Inan and Mengdi Wang in 2017) demonstrated that Policy Iteration, using these exact evaluations, requires **poly \(S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma)\) iterations** to find an *exact* optimal policy, with **no dependence on \(\epsilon\) (desired accuracy)**. This is "pretty amazing" because it contrasts with Value Iteration's \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence for approximate solutions.
    *   This means that for exact calculations, Policy Iteration, even with its expensive matrix inversion steps, offers a theoretically guaranteed polynomial time bound.

*   **Practical Considerations**:
    *   While theoretically significant for exact optimal policies, in practice, "very rarely need exact calculation," and "approximate calculations are fine". The mild \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence of Value Iteration makes it efficient for achieving good approximate solutions, often making it the preferred method for practical applications.


Comparing the runtime complexity of Policy Iteration (PI) and Value Iteration (VI) reveals distinct characteristics regarding their efficiency, especially concerning the need for exact versus approximate optimal policies.

Here's a breakdown:

### Policy Iteration (PI)

Policy Iteration is an algorithm that aims to find an **exact optimal policy**.

*   **Iteration Complexity**:
    *   The breakthrough by Yinyu Ye, Ichiro Inan, and Mengdi Wang (2017 unpublished paper) showed that Policy Iteration needs **polynomial in \(S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma)\) iterations**.
    *   This is a significant result because it means the algorithm can "stop and output an optimal policy" after this many iterations, with **no dependence on \(\epsilon\) (desired accuracy)**. The absence of the \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) term, typical for approximate methods, is considered "pretty amazing".
*   **Computational Cost per Iteration**:
    *   Each iteration of Policy Iteration involves **Policy Evaluation**, where the exact value function \(v_{\pi_k}\) for the current policy \(\pi_k\) must be computed.
    *   This is typically done by solving a linear system of equations, which often requires **matrix inversion**: \(v_\pi = (I - \gamma P_\pi)^{-1} R_\pi\) [My previous response, 17].
    *   For an \(S \times S\) matrix (where \(S\) is the number of states), matrix inversion is computationally intensive, costing roughly **\(S^3\)** (or \(S^{2.3...}\) with faster algorithms) operations. There is also an \(S^2 A\) part involved in calculations.
*   **Total Runtime Complexity**:
    *   Combining the per-iteration cost with the iteration complexity, Policy Iteration's total runtime for exact optimal policies is roughly **\(S^3 \cdot \text{poly}(S \cdot A / (1 - \gamma))\)** [implied from 20].

### Value Iteration (VI)

Value Iteration is an algorithm primarily used to find an **approximately optimal policy**.

*   **Iteration Complexity**:
    *   Value Iteration converges to an \(\epsilon\)-accurate estimate of the optimal value function, \(v^*\).
    *   The number of iterations required for this is approximately **\(\log(1/\epsilon) / \log(1/\gamma)\)**.
    *   The dependence on \(\epsilon\) is logarithmic, referred to as a "geometric rate" or "very mild," meaning it's "not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy" for *approximate* solutions.
    *   For *exact* optimal calculations, Value Iteration is "not good" and "can run indefinitely".
*   **Computational Cost per Iteration**:
    *   Each iteration of Value Iteration involves applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to the current value function estimate \(V_k\): \(V_{k+1} = T(V_k)\).
    *   This involves a finite computation for every state. For each state, you perform calculations that involve the number of actions and the number of next states. This cost is roughly **\(S \cdot A \cdot S'\)** (where \(S'\) is the number of possible next states, which can be up to \(S\)), often simplified to **\(S \cdot A \cdot S\)** or **\(S^2 A\)**.
*   **Total Runtime Complexity**:
    *   The total computational complexity for Value Iteration to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-accurate solution is approximately **\(S^2 A \cdot (\log(1/\epsilon) \cdot 1/(1-\gamma))\)** [15, implied from 11]. Specifically, it has a "log one over epsilon dependence and it also has a one over one minus gamma dependence".

In summary, Policy Iteration guarantees finding an exact optimal policy in polynomial time, even though each step is computationally expensive due to matrix inversion. Value Iteration, on the other hand, is faster per iteration but only provides an approximate solution, with the number of iterations depending on the desired accuracy. The sources note that in practice, "very rarely need exact calculation," and "approximate calculations are fine" due to the mild \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence of Value Iteration.


Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, there is **no explicit proof for a "theorem that Runtime when Controlling for the Relative Error."**

The sources discuss the runtime complexity of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration primarily in the context of achieving an **absolute error** (\(\epsilon\)) or an **exact optimal policy**.

Specifically, when discussing the accuracy of Value Iteration, the convergence rates and iteration complexities are presented for achieving an \(\epsilon\)-accurate estimate of the optimal value function, where \(\epsilon\) represents an absolute error. This means that the difference between the estimated value function and the true optimal value function is bounded by \(\epsilon\) in the max norm. The runtime for this is proportional to \(\log(1/\epsilon)\).

The lecture briefly touches upon the concept of relative error at the end, stating that it is a "different question" and "much harder" to control for relative errors, nearly akin to demanding exact calculations. The speaker notes that if one is content with an "absolute epsilon" (e.g., \(\epsilon=1\) being small compared to the maximum possible reward), then approximate calculations are "fine". However, no theorem or proof for achieving or bounding runtime for relative error is provided.

Therefore, while the sources discuss absolute error in detail, they do not offer the requested proof for runtime when controlling for relative error.


When controlling for the absolute error (\(\epsilon\)) in Value Iteration, the runtime complexity for approximate planning can be derived by combining the per-iteration computational cost with the number of iterations required to achieve a desired accuracy. Value Iteration (VI) is primarily used to find an **approximately optimal policy** [1, My previous response].

Here's the derivation:

### 1. Value Iteration Process and Convergence

*   Value Iteration begins with an arbitrary initialization, often setting \(V_0\) to zero.
*   In each subsequent iteration, the value function estimate \(V_{k+1}\) is computed by applying the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) to the previous estimate \(V_k\): \(\mathbf{V_{k+1} = T(V_k)}\).
*   This process converges to the optimal value function \(V^*\). This convergence is guaranteed by the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**, which applies because the Bellman optimality operator \(T\) is a contraction mapping in the max-norm over a complete vector space.
*   The convergence is **exponentially fast**, also described as a "geometric rate".

### 2. Error Bound per Iteration

*   The error at iteration \(k\) is typically bounded as: \(\Vert V_k - V^* \Vert_{\max} \le \gamma^k \Vert V_0 - V^* \Vert_{\max}\) [implied by 10].
*   If we initialize \(V_0 = 0\), the error bound becomes \(\Vert V_k - V^* \Vert_{\max} \le \gamma^k \Vert V^* \Vert_{\max}\).
*   For a standard MDP where rewards \(R(s,a,s')\) are normalized to be within $$, the value function for any policy, including the optimal one, is bounded. Specifically, \(\Vert V^* \Vert_{\max} \le \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\). This is because the maximum possible sum of discounted rewards along any trajectory is \(1 + \gamma + \gamma^2 + \dots = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\).
*   Combining these, the error after \(k\) iterations is bounded by: \(\mathbf{\Vert V_k - V^* \Vert_{\max} \le \gamma^k \frac{1}{1-\gamma}}\).

### 3. Number of Iterations for \(\epsilon\)-Accuracy

*   To find the number of iterations (\(k\)) required for \(V_k\) to be \(\epsilon\)-accurate (i.e., \(\Vert V_k - V^* \Vert_{\max} \le \epsilon\)), we set the error bound equal to \(\epsilon\):
    \(\gamma^k \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \le \epsilon\).
*   Solving for \(k\):
    \(\gamma^k \le \epsilon (1-\gamma)\)
    \(k \log(\gamma) \le \log(\epsilon (1-\gamma))\)
    Since \(\gamma \in (0,1)\), \(\log(\gamma)\) is negative. Dividing by \(\log(\gamma)\) reverses the inequality:
    \(\mathbf{k \ge \frac{\log(\epsilon(1-\gamma))}{\log(\gamma)}}\).
*   This can also be written as \(\mathbf{k \ge \frac{\log(1/\epsilon) + \log(1/(1-\gamma))}{\log(1/\gamma)}}\) [derived from 11].
*   The dependence on \(\epsilon\) is logarithmic (\(\log(1/\epsilon)\)), which is considered "very mild" or a "geometric rate", meaning the algorithm is "not overly sensitive to the desired accuracy" for approximate solutions.

### 4. Computational Cost per Iteration

*   Each iteration of Value Iteration involves computing \(T(V_k)\) for all \(S\) states.
*   For each state, this requires considering all \(A\) possible actions and summing over possible next states (up to \(S\) next states in the worst case).
*   Therefore, the computational cost per iteration is roughly \(\mathbf{S \cdot A \cdot S}\) (or \(S^2 A\)).

### 5. Greedification and Policy Error

*   The goal is not just an accurate value function but a **near-optimal policy**.
*   After computing \(V_k\) to be \(\epsilon\)-accurate, one obtains a policy \(\pi_k\) by **greedifying** with respect to \(V_k\). That is, for each state \(s\), \(\pi_k(s) = \operatorname{argmax}_a \{ R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V_k(s') \}\).
*   The sources demonstrate that if \(V_k\) is \(\epsilon\)-close to \(V^*\) in max-norm, then the value function of the greedy policy, \(V_{\pi_k}\), is near optimal, specifically: \(\mathbf{V_{\pi_k} \ge V^* - \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma} \mathbf{1}}\).
*   This means that the error in the policy's value function is proportional to \(\epsilon\) but gets "multiplied by a one over one minus gamma". So, if you want your policy to be \(\delta\)-optimal, you need to ensure your value function \(V_k\) is \((\delta(1-\gamma))\)-accurate.

### 6. Total Runtime Complexity

*   Combining the per-iteration cost (\(S^2 A\)) and the iteration count (proportional to \(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{1-\gamma}\)), the total runtime complexity for Value Iteration to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-optimal policy is approximately:
    \(\mathbf{O\left( S^2 A \cdot \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(1/\gamma)} \right)}\) [derived from 11, 15].
    *   More precisely, substituting the full iteration bound for a \(\delta\)-optimal policy where \(\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{1-\gamma}\):
        \(\mathbf{O\left( S^2 A \cdot \frac{\log(\epsilon)}{\log(\gamma)} + S^2 A \cdot \frac{\log(1/(1-\gamma))}{\log(\gamma)} \right)}\) [derived from 11, 15].
*   This complexity "has a log one over epsilon dependence and it also has a one over one minus gamma dependence".

### Note on Relative Error

While the above addresses runtime for absolute error, the sources note that controlling for **relative errors** is "a different question" and "much harder," almost akin to demanding exact calculations. The provided material does not offer a specific theorem or proof for runtime when controlling for relative error [My previous response].


In the context of approximate planning with Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, particularly when aiming to find an optimal or near-optimal policy in a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP), the focus is primarily on **deterministic policies**. Non-deterministic policies are considered "unnecessary" in this setting because they do not offer any advantage in achieving optimality and would significantly complicate the theoretical and algorithmic framework.

Here's a detailed explanation:

*   **The Fundamental Theorem of MDPs and Greedy Policies:** The core reason for favoring deterministic policies lies in the fundamental theorem concerning optimal policies in MDPs. This theorem states that if you have a policy \(\pi\) that is **memoryless and greedy with respect to the optimal value function (\(V^*\))**, then this policy \(\pi\) is itself an optimal policy. A greedy policy, by its very definition, involves **selecting the action that maximizes the one-step look-ahead Bellman optimality equation**. This maximization process inherently leads to a deterministic choice of action for each state. If there are multiple actions that yield the same maximal value, choosing any one of them deterministically is sufficient.
    *   The Bellman optimality operator \(T\) is defined with a \(\max_a\) operation: \(T(V)(s) = \max_a \left( R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V(s') \right)\). This operator's very structure dictates that the optimal decision involves picking the single best action (or one of the best actions if there's a tie) in each state, thereby producing a deterministic policy.

*   **Sufficiency of Deterministic Policies for Optimality:** Since a policy that is greedy with respect to \(V^*\) is guaranteed to be optimal, and a greedy policy is inherently deterministic, **there is no benefit in considering non-deterministic policies for achieving the optimal value function**. Introducing randomness (non-determinism) into action selection when a specific action (or set of tied actions) is known to yield the maximal expected future return does not improve performance and is therefore redundant for optimality.

*   **Simplification in Policy Iteration:** Policy Iteration (PI) works by iteratively improving policies. A key step in each iteration of PI is to "greedify" with respect to the value function of the current policy. As established, this greedification process naturally yields a deterministic policy for the next iteration. The sources explicitly confirm that for Policy Iteration, it's appropriate to "let these be deterministic policies because otherwise we we go nuts and like it's unnecessary to consider non-deterministic policies ever in this setting". This highlights that considering non-deterministic policies would add unnecessary complexity to the algorithm and its analysis without providing any corresponding advantage in finding optimal solutions.

In essence, the "uselessness" of non-deterministic policies in this scenario stems from the fact that **the search for an optimal policy can be entirely confined to the space of deterministic, memoryless policies** due to the properties of the Bellman optimality principle. Any non-deterministic policy can be "converted" into an equally (or more) optimal deterministic policy by simply choosing the best action in each state.


The best lower bound mentioned in the sources for the computational complexity of finding optimal policies in finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is **\(S^2 A\)**.

This lower bound comes from an unpublished paper by Ichinose, Chandrasekaran, and Wong from 2017. It applies specifically to scenarios where you need to perform **exact calculations** to find an optimal policy, without approximations.

Here's a breakdown of the scenario and reasoning behind this lower bound:

*   **MDP Structure**:
    *   The MDP has `S-2` states, plus "heaven" and "hell" states.
    *   In each state, there are `A` available actions.
    *   An action can either lead to "heaven" (a state with constant rewards) or "hell" (a state with no rewards).
    *   The challenge is to identify, for each state, the *one* action that leads to "heaven" (i.e., makes you act optimally).

*   **The "Reading" Problem**:
    *   To determine the optimal action, you essentially need to "read the whole table of S-square A transition probabilities". This table describes, for every state-action pair, where you will transition.
    *   The problem is constructed such that for most state-action pairs, the transitions lead to "hell," but there's a unique "heaven" transition that you must find.
    *   Finding this optimal action requires looking at each state-action pair to see if it leads to "heaven" or "hell." This is akin to searching an array.
    *   A randomized algorithm that achieves this would require approximately `S/2` reads for each state-action pair, meaning you effectively need to check a significant portion of all `S * A` possibilities.

*   **Implications of the Lower Bound**:
    *   This \(S^2 A\) lower bound is notable because, unlike some of the upper bounds for Policy Iteration (which is designed for exact calculations), it **does not include a \(1/(1-\gamma)\) dependence**. This quantity, \(1/(1-\gamma)\), often appears in upper bounds and is related to the effective planning horizon in discounted MDPs.
    *   The existence of this lower bound implies that if one requires an **optimal action for *every* state** (meaning you must "write at least S values" as output), then there is no way to perform fewer calculations than this \(S^2 A\) scale.
    *   The speaker notes that the exact polynomial dependence on `S`, `A`, and `1/(1-gamma)` in various algorithms (including Policy Iteration) is a "very delicate question".
    *   However, if the problem can be modified such that you don't need to find an optimal policy for all states (e.g., only for a specific starting state), it might be possible to reduce the dependence on the number of states `S`.



The derivation of the \(S^2 A\) lower bound for finding optimal policies in finite MDPs relies on a specific, carefully constructed problem that exposes the minimum computational effort required. The key dependencies or assumptions in this argument are:

*   **A Specific MDP Construction**: The argument uses an MDP with `S-2` regular states, plus two special states: "heaven" and "hell".
    *   In each of the `S-2` regular states, there are `A` possible actions.
    *   For any given state-action pair, the transition can either lead to "heaven" (a state with constant rewards) or "hell" (a state with no rewards).
    *   The problem is designed such that for most state-action pairs, the transitions lead to "hell." However, there's a unique "heaven" transition for each state, which corresponds to the optimal action.

*   **The "Reading" Problem**: To identify the optimal action in each state, one effectively needs to **"read the whole table of S-square A transition probabilities"**. This is because:
    *   The optimal action for a given state is the one that leads to "heaven".
    *   To discover which action leads to "heaven," you must inspect the transition probabilities for each state-action pair.
    *   This is likened to searching an array: you cannot determine the optimal action without examining a significant portion of the `S * A` possibilities. A randomized algorithm for this problem would require approximately `S/2` reads for each state-action pair, leading to the \(S^2 A\) lower bound.

*   **Requirement for an Optimal Policy at *Every* State**: A crucial dependency for this \(S^2 A\) lower bound is the requirement to find an optimal policy, meaning you must identify the **optimal action for *every* state**.
    *   This implies that the output of the algorithm must "write at least S values" (one for each state).
    *   If this requirement were relaxed, for instance, if only an optimal action for a *specific starting state* was needed, it might be possible to reduce the dependency on the number of states `S`. However, as the problem is formulated for this lower bound, the output itself requires a minimum of `S` operations, leading to the overall \(S^2 A\) complexity.

The argument highlights that to guarantee finding the optimal action across all states, an algorithm inherently must "look at all the states in this set of s-2 possible states". This is why the \(S^2 A\) lower bound does not include the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) term, which is typically associated with the planning horizon in discounted MDPs and often appears in the upper bounds of algorithms like Policy Iteration for exact calculations.



Our conversation has touched upon the core aspects of deterministic policies, Policy Iteration (PI), Value Iteration (VI), and computational complexity. However, delving deeper into the provided sources reveals several nuanced insights that enhance our understanding:

*   **The Practicality of Deterministic Policies:** Beyond merely being "unnecessary" for optimality, considering non-deterministic policies would make the theoretical and algorithmic framework significantly more complex, as the lecturer states, "otherwise we we go nuts". The entire structure of the Bellman optimality operator, with its \(\max_a\) operation, inherently drives towards deterministic choices, simplifying analysis and algorithm design. The proofs of the fundamental theorem and the convergence of PI and VI implicitly rely on this simplification.

*   **Policy Iteration's Unique Convergence Mechanism ("Elimination"):** While Value Iteration converges by iteratively refining value functions, Policy Iteration has a distinct "elimination" property. A key part of its convergence proof demonstrates that if you start with a non-optimal policy, after a certain number of iterations (\(K^*\), roughly \(\log \text{factors } SA / (1-\gamma)\)), there exists at least one state where the action chosen by the initial non-optimal policy will **never be chosen again** by subsequent iterates. This mechanism implies that PI effectively "crosses out" suboptimal actions, systematically narrowing down the choices until only optimal ones remain.

*   **Value Iteration's Limitation for *Exact* Calculation:** Although Value Iteration converges geometrically fast for approximate solutions (with a desirable \(\log(1/\epsilon)\) dependence on accuracy), it is **"not good for exact calculation"**. This is because it's possible to construct scenarios where the value differences between actions become infinitesimally small, making the final convergence to the *exact* optimal policy take an "arbitrary large amount of time". This highlights a crucial distinction between VI (best for approximate optimality) and PI (capable of exact optimality).

*   **The "Delicate Question" of Computational Dependence:** The precise polynomial dependence of algorithms on parameters like the number of states (\(S\)), actions (\(A\)), and the discount factor's inverse planning horizon (\(1/(1-\gamma)\)) is a "very delicate question". This implies that while upper and lower bounds exist, finding the *tightest* possible bounds remains an active area of research and is not fully settled. The repeated appearance of \(1/(1-\gamma)\) in upper bounds is "curious," and whether its presence is truly inherent to the problem's complexity or an artifact of current analyses is part of this "delicate question".

*   **The Absence of \(1/(1-\gamma)\) in the Lower Bound's Implication:** The \(S^2 A\) lower bound is significant because, unlike many upper bounds, it **does not contain the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) term**. This suggests that for the specific problem of finding an optimal action for *every* state (which is the basis of this lower bound), the minimum computational cost is primarily dictated by the sheer size of the state-action space that *must* be examined to locate the "heaven" transitions, rather than the planning horizon imposed by the discount factor. This implies a fundamental cost irrespective of how heavily discounted future rewards are.

*   **Context for "Exact" vs. "Approximate" Solutions:** The lecturer offers a practical perspective on the need for exact solutions, stating that "very rarely need exact calculation" in real-world applications, and that practitioners "should be happy with approximate" solutions if the absolute error \(\epsilon\) is small relative to the expected rewards or values. This underscores that theoretical exactness, while important for foundational understanding, may not always be the practical objective.

*   **Fixed Number of States Exception:** For MDPs with a small, fixed number of states, one could theoretically enumerate all \(A^S\) possible deterministic policies. In this specific case, it's possible to find the optimal policy and its value function independent of the \(1/(1-\gamma)\) term, by simply calculating the value for each policy and choosing the best. This contrasts with scenarios where \(S\) is large, requiring more sophisticated algorithmic approaches whose complexity often *does* depend on \(1/(1-\gamma)\).
