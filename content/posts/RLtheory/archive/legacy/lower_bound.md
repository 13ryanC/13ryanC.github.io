### Internal plan (public outline)

| Sub‑task | Goal                                                                                                                             | Verification                                                                  |   |   |   |                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | - | - | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Formalise the two‑state MDP** (states, actions, transitions, rewards) and solve for the *exact* optimal value function \(v^\*\). | Derive closed‑form \(v^\*(A)=v^\*(B)=\tfrac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}\).    |   |   |   |                                                     |
| 2        | Introduce an *approximate* value function \(v\) that under‑/over‑estimates the true values by \(\pm\varepsilon\).                    | Check that \(\|v-v^\*\|_\infty=\varepsilon\).                                   |   |   |   |                                                     |
| 3        | Compute action‑values \(q_v(\cdot,\cdot)\) and identify a policy \(\pi\) that is greedy w\.r.t. \(v\).                                 | Show that ties occur and that the always‑\(b\) policy is greedy.                |   |   |   |                                                     |
| 4        | Evaluate \(v_\pi\) and compare to \(v^\*\).                                                                                          | Show \(v_\pi(A)=v_\pi(B)=0\) and loss \(= \tfrac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}\). |   |   |   |                                                     |
| 5        | Conclude **tightness** of the theorem’s performance bound.                                                                       | Loss equals the upper bound, so it cannot be improved.                        |   |   |   |                                                     |
| 6        | State the Chen & Wang (2017) computational lower bound and give pointer.                                                         | Cite: Ω((                                                                     | S | , | A | )/( \varepsilon^2(1-\gamma)^3)) sample complexity . |

---

## Step 1 – Exact optimal value function \(v^\*\)

**MDP specification**

* **States**: \(S=\{A,B\}\).
* **Actions**: \(\{a,b\}\).
* **Discount factor**: \(0<\gamma<1\).
* **Deterministic dynamics & rewards**

| Current state | Action | Next state | Immediate reward     |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| \(A\) or \(B\)    | \(a\)    | \(A\)        | \(2\gamma\varepsilon\) |
| \(A\) or \(B\)    | \(b\)    | \(B\)        | \(0\)                  |

**Bellman optimality equations**

Because the next state after \(a\) is always \(A\) and after \(b\) is always \(B\):

$$
\begin{aligned}
v^\*(A)&=\max\{\,2\gamma\varepsilon+\gamma v^\*(A),\; 0+\gamma v^\*(B)\},\\
v^\*(B)&=\max\{\,2\gamma\varepsilon+\gamma v^\*(A),\; 0+\gamma v^\*(B)\}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Guess (and later verify) that action \(a\) is optimal everywhere.  Plugging that into the first equation gives

$$
v^\*(A)=2\gamma\varepsilon+\gamma v^\*(A)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
v^\*(A)=\frac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}.
$$

For state \(B\),

$$
v^\*(B)=2\gamma\varepsilon+\gamma v^\*(A)
       =2\gamma\varepsilon+\gamma\frac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}
       =\frac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}=v^\*(A).
$$

Thus **both states share the same optimal value**

$$
\boxed{\,v^\*(A)=v^\*(B)=\dfrac{2\gamma\varepsilon}{1-\gamma}\,}.
$$

*Verification*: substituting back confirms that choosing \(a\) indeed yields the larger (and equal) value in each state, so the solution is consistent.

---

### Progress

* Derived and **verified** the exact optimal values \(v^\*\) for the constructed MDP.
* Open issues for the next step

  1. Define the perturbed value \(v\) with \(\pm\varepsilon\) errors.
  2. Show why the always‑\(b\) policy is greedy w\.r.t. \(v\).
  3. Compute its performance to demonstrate tightness.
  4. Present Chen & Wang (2017) lower‑bound statement with interpretation.

Let me know if you’d like me to continue to these next steps.

### Internal plan — decomposition for a full account of PI complexity

| sub‑question                                                                                                           | key checkpoints & tools                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1.** What *exactly* is (Howard) Policy Iteration and what cost model do we use?                                     | formal definition from discounted‑MDP folklore; cite Ye (2011). |
| **Q2.** What was known *before* 2011 and why exponential lower bounds were an obstacle?                                | brief historical recap; older negative results.                 |
| **Q3.** Ye (2011) result: statement, complexity bound, main proof idea (potential‑decrease via reduced costs).         | quote/cite theorem lines.                                       |

| **Q5.** Side‑by‑side comparison and intuitive map of both proofs.                                                      | table of similarities/differences.                              |
| **Q6.** Subsequent refinements (2016‑2025) & open problems.                                                            | brief survey, open conjectures.                                 |

I will proceed **incrementally**.
Below I execute **Q1 + Q3** (formal setup **and** Ye’s theorem) so we have a precise baseline.
Further steps (Scherrer, comparison, later work) will follow once you review this.

---

## Step 1 — Formal setup + Ye (2011) breakthrough

### 1 · Setting and notation

Consider a finite discounted Markov Decision Process
\((\mathcal S,(\mathcal A_i)_{i\in\mathcal S},P,r,\gamma)\) with

* \(|\mathcal S|=m\) states, total actions \(n=\sum_i |\mathcal A_i|\),
* stochastic matrices \(P_{a}\) (row \(i\) gives \(p_{ij}^{(a)}\)),
* bounded rewards \(r_a(i)\), and fixed discount \(0<\gamma<1\).

For a **stationary policy** \(\pi:\mathcal S\to\mathcal A\) let
\(P_\pi\) be the induced transition matrix and \(r_\pi\in\mathbb R^{m}\) its reward vector.
The value obeys the Bellman system

$$
v_\pi = r_\pi + \gamma P_\pi v_\pi .
$$

---

### 2 · Howard Policy Iteration (PI)

*Initialisation* Pick any policy \(\pi^{(0)}\).
*Iterate* \(t=0,1,\dots\)

1. **Policy‑evaluation** Solve \(v^{(t)} = r_{\pi^{(t)}} + \gamma P_{\pi^{(t)}} v^{(t)}\).
2. **Improvement** For every state \(i\) replace the action by

$$
\pi^{(t+1)}(i)\;\in\;\arg\max_{a\in\mathcal A_i} 
\Bigl[r_a(i) + \gamma\, (P_a v^{(t)})_i\Bigr].
$$

The algorithm stops when no switch occurs (greedy w\.r.t. \(v^{(t)}\)), hence \(\pi^{(t)}\) is optimal.
Howard’s PI is equivalent to the simplex method on a specially structured linear program, where each “pivot” simultaneously changes all improving actions. ([web.stanford.edu][1])

---

### 3 · Ye (2011): first **strongly‑polynomial** bound

> **Theorem (Ye 2011).**
> With discount factor \(\gamma\) treated as a constant, Howard’s PI (and its simplex one‑action variant) terminates after at most
>
> $$
> \boxed{\; \displaystyle 
> \frac{m^{2}(k-1)}{1-\gamma}\;
> \log\!\Bigl(\frac{m^{2}}{1-\gamma}\Bigr)
> \;}
> $$
>
> iterations where \(k=\max_i |\mathcal A_i|\).
> Each iteration needs \(O(m^{2}k)\) arithmetic operations; consequently PI is **strongly polynomial** in \((m,k)\). ([web.stanford.edu][1])

*Proof idea (high level)*

1. **LP view & potentials.**  Embed the discounted‑MDP into a linear program; the reduced cost of a non‑basic variable equals the *advantage* of switching that action.
2. **Progress measure.**  Define a potential \(Φ^{(t)} = \max_{a\notin\pi^{(t)}}\{-\text{redcost}(a)\}\).
   Each PI step reduces \(Φ^{(t)}\) by at least a constant *multiplicative* factor \((1-\frac{1-\gamma}{m})\).
3. **Bounding the initial gap.**  Using spectral radii bounds, \(Φ^{(0)}\le m/(1-\gamma)\).
4. **Geometric decay ⇒ logarithmic iterations.**  Combine 2 + 3 to obtain the iteration bound above.

This was the first time one could assert, *independent of reward bit‑length*, that a pivoting‑rule version of PI always finishes in poly\((m,n)\) steps.

### Progress

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Defined discounted‑MDP model and classic Policy Iteration.                                           |        |
| Stated Ye’s 2011 strong‑poly theorem with exact bound and proof skeleton, citing the original lines. |        |

**Open next steps**

* Explain how Bruno Scherrer (2016) shortens the argument and tightens the iteration bound to \(O\!\bigl(\tfrac{m}{1-\gamma}\log\tfrac1{1-\gamma}\bigr)\) and derives γ‑free bounds via \(\tau_t,\tau_r\).
* Compare both proofs conceptually and algorithmically.
* Summarise later developments (smoothed analysis, parity‑game links, open conjectures when γ is part of the input).

Let me know if you’d like me to continue with Scherrer (2016) and the comparative analysis, or explore any specific angle in depth.

Below is a compact brief of the **main complexity advances on (Howard) Policy Iteration that appeared after Bruno Scherrer’s 2016 bound, focusing on papers dated 2024 – mid‑2025**.  Each item states exactly **what changed**, **how it was proved**, and **where the remaining gaps lie**.

---

## 1.  Upper‑bound breakthrough: sub‑exponential for deterministic MDPs

**Mukherjee & Kalyanakrishnan, May 2025**
*Paper:* “Howard’s Policy Iteration is Subexponential for Deterministic Markov Decision Problems with Rewards of Fixed Bit‑size and Arbitrary Discount Factor.”
*Result (Thm 1.2).*  For an \(n\)-state deterministic MDP (any discount \(\gamma\)) whose rewards use at most \(b\) bits, HPI visits at most

$$
n\,k \; \exp\!\Bigl(\tilde{O}\bigl(\sqrt{n\,b}\;+\;b\bigr)\Bigr)
$$

policies.  When rewards are constant‑bit (the practical case), this is **\(n^{\,O(\sqrt{n})}\)**—the first sub‑exponential *worst‑case* bound independent of \(\gamma\).&#x20;

*Technique.*  The authors upper‑bound the **“Blackwell threshold”** \(\gamma_Q\) below which all switch decisions of HPI stabilise.  They show that \(\tfrac1{1-\gamma_Q}\) is at most the largest root of a family of **integer polynomials of height \(2^{b}\)** and degree \(O(n)\).  An adaptation of a zero‑location theorem of Borwein‑Erdélyi‑Kós then yields the root bound, which converts Scherrer’s 2013 \(\tfrac{nk}{1-\gamma}\log \tfrac1{1-\gamma}\) iteration bound into the expression above.

*Impact.*  - Breaks the exponential barrier even when the discount is given in binary.

* Shifts the bottleneck from \(\gamma\) to the reward bit‑length \(b\).
* Leaves open whether a **truly polynomial** bound (in \(n,k,b\)) is attainable.

---

## 2.  Matching progress on the *lower* side: quadratic worst case

**Asadi–Chatterjee–de Raaij, June 2025**
*Paper:* “Lower Bound on Howard Policy Iteration for Deterministic Markov Decision Processes.”
*Result (Thm 3.2).*  They construct a family of \(2n\)-vertex deterministic graphs on which HPI performs

$$
\Omega(n^{2})
$$

iterations for the mean‑payoff (and for discounted‑sum with \(\gamma\) sufficiently close to 1).  This improves the previous \(\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{I})\) bound (where \(I\) is input size) and shows that the quadratic upper bounds of Hansen et al. (2013) cannot be reduced below \(n^{2-o(1)}\) without new ideas. ([arxiv.org][1])

*Technique.*  A carefully layered “deceleration lane” gadget forces HPI to move an improving action one state at a time; a combinatorial charging argument proves every intermediate policy is visited.

---

## 3.  Smoothed–analysis: why bad instances are fragile

**Loff & Skomra, Feb 2024**
*Paper:* “Smoothed Analysis of Deterministic Discounted and Mean‑Payoff Games.”
*Result.*  For any deterministic MDP or two‑player game whose edge weights are independently perturbed by a tiny Gaussian, a variant of policy iteration terminates in time polynomial in \(n\) and in a condition number measuring the perturbation size—*with high probability*.  This confirms a conjecture by Boros et al. and contrasts sharply with the worst‑case lower bounds.&#x20;

*Take‑away.*  Exponential examples appear to be measure‑zero; in practice HPI is likely fast unless the instance is (nearly) adversarially engineered.

---

## 4.  Two‑player side‑branch: sub‑exponential strategy iteration

**Asadi et al., LICS 2024**
*Paper:* “Deterministic Sub‑exponential Algorithm for Discounted‑sum Games with Unary Weights.”
*Result.*  Strategy‑iteration (the natural extension of HPI to zero‑sum games) runs in

$$
n^{\,O\!\bigl(W^{1/4}\sqrt{n}\bigr)}
$$

steps when the weights are written in unary.  Although games are harder than 1‑player MDPs (NP ∩ co‑NP), the proof again hinges on bounding roots of integer polynomials. ([arxiv.org][2])

*Relevance.*  Highlights that the polynomial‑root toolbox underpinning Mukherjee–Kalyanakrishnan also scales to adversarial settings.

---

## 5.  What has **not** moved (yet)

| Open problem                                                                                | Current status (June 2025)                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strongly‑polynomial bound for HPI when the *discount is part of the input*                  | Still **open**. All strongly‑poly results (Ye 2011, Post‑Ye 2015, Scherrer 2016) assume \(\gamma\) is a fixed constant. |
| Better than \(O(nk/(1-\gamma))\) when rewards are unrestricted and transitions are stochastic | No progress beyond Scherrer’s \(O\!\bigl(\tfrac{nk}{1-\gamma}\log\tfrac1{1-\gamma}\bigr)\).                             |
| Tight worst‑case lower bound for deterministic MDPs with small rewards                      | Upper = sub‑exp (Item 1), lower = \(n^{2}\) (Item 2). Exponential gap persists.                                         |
| Smoothed analysis for **stochastic** MDPs                                                   | Christ–Yannakakis 2023 showed *sub‑exponential* lower bounds; no positive results so far.                             |

---

### Take‑home picture

The years 2024‑2025 have **fractured the long‑standing stalemate**:

* The first *sub‑exponential* **upper** bound for deterministic models (Item 1).
* The first *quadratic* **lower** bound that matches upper bounds up to log‑factors (Item 2).
* A **probabilistic guarantee** that worst‑cases are rare in practice (Item 3).

Yet a fully **polynomial** analysis of Howard’s classical algorithm—when both the discount factor and rewards are given in binary—remains one of the most tantalising open questions in algorithmic MDP theory.

Below is a curated snapshot of **what has actually changed since the classic Chen & Wang (2017) Ω(|S|²|A|) lower bound**—focusing strictly on *new* (2024‑2025) hardness or tightness results for discounted‐ or closely‑related MDPs.  I group the progress by theme and clearly flag how each paper refines, extends or circumscribes the original barrier.

### Take‑away

Chen & Wang’s Ω(|S|²|A|) still rules the *dense‑table* input model, but fine‑grained complexity and span‑based arguments now reveal *where* that cost hides: either in the large bias span H, or in the need to revisit almost every state after a small model tweak.

## 3 Structural or “easier than worst case” regimes

While the papers above harden the barrier, several 2024‑2025 works *bypass* it by exploiting additional structure:

* **Separated latent MDPs** — near‑optimal learning becomes possible once the latent models are δ‑separated; the hard SA/(1–γ)³ factor re‑emerges only when separation shrinks ([arxiv.org][5]).
* **Anchoring & plug‑in reductions** — by recasting average‑reward tasks as *instance‑specific* discounted problems, new algorithms obtain Õ(SA H/(1–γ)² ε²) without contradicting the universal Ω̃(SA/(1–γ)³ ε²) lower bound, because the latter applies to *worst‑case* γ choice ([arxiv.org][3], [sites.google.com][1]).

These results do **not** beat Chen‑Wang in the dense‑table model; they operate in the *generative* model where only SA queries are information‑theoretically unavoidable.

## 4 Lens on *fine‑grained* versus *information‑theoretic* hardness

| Barrier type                 | Dominant factor (2025 landscape)                                | Typical proof tool                                                               |                                 |                                                                                  |

| **Dense input running time** |                                                                 | S                                                                                | ²A (or SAH in dynamic settings) | Decision‑tree / ETH or SETH reductions (Chen‑Wang 2017; Peng‑Papadimitriou 2024) |
| **Generative‑model samples** | SA/(1–γ)³ ε² (worst case)  **↔** SA H / ε² (instance dependent) | Yao + change‑of‑measure hard instances (Azar‑Munos‑Kappen 2012; Zurek‑Chen 2024) |                                 |                                                                                  |

## 5 Practical implications

* **Tabular planning software** still cannot asymptotically beat *quadratic in |S|* time unless it stores transitions in a sampler‑friendly form.
* **Model‑free RL** now has *provably minimal* sample budgets even for difficult average‑reward tasks, provided one measures difficulty via the bias‑span H rather than (1–γ) alone.
* **Risk management** in RL is inherently harder: tightening confidence intervals in risk‑sensitive objectives incurs an unavoidable exponential horizon blow‑up.
* **Continual‑learning systems** must be prepared to *re‑solve* large fractions of the MDP after environment drift—there is little theoretical room for incremental shortcuts in the worst case.

4. O. Mortensen & M. S. Talebi, *Entropic Risk Optimization in Discounted MDPs*, arXiv 2506.00286 ([arxiv.org][4])

These works, taken together, delineate the state of the art as of mid‑2025.  No paper has yet overturned the fundamental Ω(|S|²|A|) barrier for dense explicit MDPs, but our understanding of *when and why* that cost bites—and how it interacts with horizon, span, risk and non‑stationarity—has sharpened considerably over the last two years.
