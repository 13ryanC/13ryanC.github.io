# Multi-Agent Primer

This primer collects foundational readings that prepare learners for the broader multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) module. Begin here to understand the motivation, modeling assumptions, and core building blocks that distinguish MARL from single-agent RL.

## Learning Progression

### 1. Motivation and Scope
- **Why MARL?** ([published article](../../../published/topics/multi-agent-rl/motivation.md))
  - When single-agent RL breaks down
  - Real-world coordination and competition scenarios
  - Canonical challenges unique to MARL

### 2. Modeling Fundamentals
- **Foundations** ([published overview](../../../published/topics/multi-agent-rl/foundations.md))
  - Sequential multi-agent decision processes
  - Observability and information structures
  - Architectural choices for agent communication

- **Decision Making Models** ([published guide](../../../published/topics/multi-agent-rl/decision-making-models.md))
  - Normal-form, repeated, and stochastic games
  - POSGs and information partitions
  - From cooperative to competitive settings

### 3. Core Environment Mechanics
- **Agent Knowledge and Observability** ([published chapter](../../../published/topics/multi-agent-rl/agent-knowledge.md))
  - Belief modeling and transparency
  - Designing observation channels and privacy constraints

- **Actions and Rewards** ([published chapter](../../../published/topics/multi-agent-rl/actions-rewards.md))
  - Joint action spaces and coordination
  - Credit assignment profiles
  - Reward shaping for team success

## Prerequisites
- **Foundations Module**: Sequential decision processes, MDP basics
- **Algorithms Module**: Policy evaluation and improvement concepts
- Introductory game theory (normal-form games and Nash equilibria)

## Next Steps
- Move to the **Multi-Agent Advanced** track for algorithmic templates and CTDE design
- Consult the **Theory Module** for equilibrium analysis and convergence guarantees
- Explore **Applications Module** case studies for deployment patterns

## Cross-References
- `../advanced/index.md` – Advanced MARL algorithms and CTDE
- `../../theory/solution_concepts_equilibrium.md` – Equilibrium concepts underpinning MARL
- `../../applications/engineering_experimentation.md` – Engineering considerations shared with MARL deployments

## Key Takeaways
1. Multi-agent problems extend MDPs with strategic interaction and partial observability.
2. Coordination costs, communication limits, and credit assignment motivate specialized algorithms.
3. A strong grounding in single-agent RL and game theory enables rapid progress through advanced MARL methods.
