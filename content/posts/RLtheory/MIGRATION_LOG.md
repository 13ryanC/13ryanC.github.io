# RLtheory Migration Log

## Phase 0 – Backup and Validation (2025-09-16)
- Backup created at `/tmp/rltheory-backup-20250916-211058` prior to cleanup.
- Markdown file inventory at start of migration: 203 files (expected 172 per manifest; new total logged for reconciliation).
- Git status captured; repository not clean due to pre-existing edits tracked separately.
- Migration log initialized to track phase-by-phase execution.

## Phase 1 – Directory Structure Creation (2025-09-16)
- Created top-level directories: `published/`, `drafts/`, `resources/`, `archive/` with required subfolders.
- Added specialized subdirectories for published topics (OaK, multi-agent RL, multi-agent systems, distributional RL), reference materials, and draft topic buckets.
- Structure aligns with taxonomy in `STRUCTURE.md` for downstream migrations.

## Phase 2 – Cleanup Operations (2025-09-16)
- Confirmed removal of all editor backup and temporary files (residual count: 0).
- Relocated `legacy/` tree into `archive/legacy/` to align with archival strategy.

## Phase 3 – High Priority Migrations (2025-09-16)
- Published foundational series relocated: `RL_notes_P1`–`P3` now in `published/foundations/` with canonical filenames.
- Multi-agent primer and advanced chapters promoted to `published/topics/multi-agent-rl/`; centralized vs decentralized article copied to drafts for continued iteration.
- OaK and MAS topic files moved into `published/topics/oak/` and `published/topics/multi-agent-systems/` respectively.
- Draft foundations reorganized into `drafts/foundations/`, including P1–P4 series and MDP/model-based/model-free chapters.
- Core multi-agent drafts moved under `drafts/topics/multi-agent-rl/` buckets, establishing convergence, opponent modeling, deep function approximation, and support docs.

## Phase 4 – Medium Priority Content (2025-09-16)
- Sutton & Barto summaries migrated into `published/reference/sutton-barto-2018/` with normalized filenames and refreshed front matter (`category: "Reference"`, unified series tag, `lastmod` set to today).
- Compiled chapter index created to surface reference coverage and navigation links.
- Distributional RL sequence relocated to `drafts/topics/distributional-rl/` with kebab-case filenames for consistency.
- Remaining topic modules (advanced, algorithms, applications, foundations, theory) collapsed into `drafts/topics/` subtrees; added multi-agent primer navigation to published structure and advanced index to drafts.

## Phase 5 – Low Priority Migrations (2025-09-16)
- Archived historical drafts in `archive/versions/` and relocated orphaned standalone notes to `archive/standalone/`.
- Relocated `mdp.md` and `motivation.md` into standalone archive slots with descriptive filenames.
- Moved all support assets into the `resources/` tree: diagrams, PDF references (including Sutton & Barto chapter exports), and planning documents.
- Authored resource index files for images, papers, and plans to improve discoverability.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance (2025-09-16)
- Verified Markdown count across `published/`, `drafts/`, `resources/`, and `archive/` (203 files, inclusive of new resource indices and raw chapter exports).
- Confirmed no Markdown remains at repo root outside of manifest/checklist/log set.
- Automated front matter check across published content; no gaps identified.
- Enumerated large files (>50KB) to ensure relocation preserved heavyweight chapters and archive artifacts.
- Ran quick link audit for relative references; MARL cross-references updated earlier remain clean.

## Phase 7 – Cleanup & Documentation (2025-09-16)
- Deleted empty directories post-migration and relocated planning/docs into the `resources/plans/` hub.
- Created/updated resource indices (images, papers, plans) and ensured `topics/README.md` now points at published routes.
- Finalized MIGRATION_CHECKLIST with all tasks marked complete and noted adjustments to validation expectations.
