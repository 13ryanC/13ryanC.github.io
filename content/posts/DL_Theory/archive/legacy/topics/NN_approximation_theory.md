# A Unified Roadmap for Neural Network Approximation Theory
*Based on Marcus Hutter's "Introduction to Neural-Network Approximation Theory"*

## Executive Summary

This exposition provides a rigorous, self-contained treatment of neural network approximation theory that bridges classical mathematical analysis with modern deep learning practice. The roadmap is designed to scale from a comprehensive survey article (~40 pages) to book-chapter depth, with each section building incrementally toward a complete understanding of when, why, and how neural networks can approximate functions.
